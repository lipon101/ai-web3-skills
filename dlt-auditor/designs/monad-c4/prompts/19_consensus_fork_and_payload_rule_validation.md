Hunt for consensus-rule validation bugs in a blockchain or DLT codebase.

Focus on externally supplied or consensus-layer supplied blocks, headers, payloads, forkchoice states, receipts, sidecars, and payload attributes before they affect canonical state, payload building, execution, or success responses.

Search patterns:
- Deployment or upgrade validators where existing callable interfaces, constructors, entrypoints, input/output types, or verifier artifacts must be preserved across a consensus-version gate.
- Consensus proof, puzzle, or work-verification APIs that can be called without the active target, difficulty, epoch, fork, or rule context as an explicit input.
- Admission checks for new syntax, opcodes, transaction variants, or program editions that are implemented in one verifier but missing from replay, upgrade, migration, or deployment-validation paths.
- A fork or feature predicate called with fewer inputs than the protocol rule requires, such as height without timestamp, parent total difficulty without current difficulty, method version without message kind, or activation state without chain variant.
- Adjacent fork predicate mistakes: code implementing a rule introduced at fork N guarded by fork N+1, fork N-1, a timestamp-only helper, or a generic upstream fork predicate that omits the chain variant. Test exactly before activation, at activation, and after activation.
- A generic mainnet or base-chain validator reused for a chain variant that has different field presence, value, or timing rules.
- Chain variants that import an upstream fork format but disable a subfeature. Validate both field shape and local value invariants; a field may be required by the inherited format while still constrained to nil, zero, empty, or forbidden-by-policy values by the local chain.
- In rollup or multi-domain derivation pipelines, compare the trusted origin context with payload-carried timestamps, origins, fork markers, and batch metadata. Fork or feature gates should use the trusted origin when the protocol defines the gate there, not a value decoded from untrusted batch contents.
- Header or payload fields checked in one import path but omitted in sidechain, downloaded, recovery, optimistic, reorg, replay, or Engine API paths.
- Work-, weight-, or difficulty-based protocols where verifiers trust a peer-supplied header field instead of recomputing it from parent state, active rules, timestamp or height, and local consensus parameters.
- Fork choice or sync reorg decisions that compare height, response length, claimed tip, or local heuristics when the protocol's canonical rule is accumulated work, weight, score, or certified strength from a common ancestor.
- Canonical commitments such as transaction root, receipt root, withdrawal root, blob commitment, state root, generated-system-work root, recovered sender, replay-protection flags, or terminal-total-difficulty conditions enforced in one path but omitted in replay, compatibility, recovery, signing, or side import paths. Recompute body and payload commitments before execution or success, not only in the happy-path import flow.
- Block execution paths that persist transaction status, receipts, generated messages, or commitments before final block identity, canonical serialized transaction bytes, and final success or revert status are known. Consensus-visible outputs should be derived from finalized canonical data.
- Execution-state side effects that influence consensus roots, such as account touches, empty-account deletion, gas accounting, generated transactions, receipts, logs, refunds, or storage journaling, where one edge-case path updates the committed state but not the journal or rollback state.
- Consensus-visible state updates, reward distribution, slashing/accountability updates, and emitted result data must not depend on unordered map or hash-table iteration. In Go maps, Rust hash maps, JavaScript object maps, database iteration without a canonical order, or any similar unordered collection, require explicit sorting before any state write, reward calculation, event emission, app-hash input, or results-hash input.
- Check conversions between aggregate batch formats and per-block or per-transaction formats. A span, segment, or aggregate batch must not produce child payloads whose origin, parent, timestamp, fork activation, or safe-head relation is older or weaker than the boundary being processed.
- Check fallback payload construction paths such as deposits-only, system-transaction-only, invalid-payload recovery, or post-execution metadata paths. The fallback must filter exactly the allowed transaction classes and must clear or rebuild cached attributes that came from the invalid path.
- Early returns that process payload attributes, return VALID, or update head/safe/finalized state before forkchoice consistency checks run.
- For rollups, distinguish unsafe, local-safe, cross-safe, finalized, and disputed target states. Code must not relabel unsafe data as safe/finalized during startup, sync completion, rewind, or recovery without re-deriving that label from authoritative protocol context.
- Parent, ancestor, finalized, safe, or invalid-state decisions keyed by one coordinate while the protocol identity includes hash, number, parent hash, and validity status.
- Special cases for synthetic payloads, segmented blocks, zero hashes, legacy fixtures, or compatibility modes that skip broad validation instead of only the specific non-comparable field.
- Error paths that collapse invalid-block, invalid-header, or sender-recovery failures into generic execution or internal errors that higher layers cannot treat as invalid.
- Equal-score, equal-work, equal-total-difficulty, same-height, or same-round tie-breaks that use randomness or local heuristics without an explicit protocol or policy rule.
- Finalization, post-execution, state-sync, deposit, withdrawal, or system-transaction paths that derive extra receipts, generated transactions, or state changes. Check that the block body, locally derived system work, receipts, and state root are cross-checked before success and that unsupported fields fail closed.
- Fork-aware hashing, signing, opcode decoding, and header sanity paths where the canonical object shape changes by fork. Check that every verifier, signer, replay path, and helper includes exactly the fields active for that fork and rejects fields forbidden before or after the fork.
- Consensus validation that depends on an external chain or consensus client. Check that time-based or latest queries are first pinned to a deterministic height/hash/finality boundary, and that all validators would query the same snapshot for the same local block.
- ABCI, consensus API, proposal-building, or proposal-processing paths that embed or consume validator vote extensions, side votes, committee votes, or aggregate approvals. Check that every path validates signer identity, signature, duplicate votes, voting power, quorum, height, round, proposer, and block/domain context before proposal acceptance or tallying.
- proposal/validation consensus systems where agreement is over transaction sets, close times, trusted validator or committee validations, and prior-ledger identity rather than only block payloads. Check that proposal duplicate suppression, transaction-set ordering, wrong-ledger mode, and switch-ledger or catch-up mode bind proposal hash, prior state, sequence, signer, and active rules
- amendment, fork, or feature activation votes where quorum or majority thresholds are computed by integer or rounded arithmetic. Test boundary values just below and above the policy threshold and ensure small validator sets cannot produce impossible or unsafe quorum requirements
- Federated quorum, validator-set, committee, and trust-list predicates should be tested at exact threshold boundaries, especially N-T, N-T+1, ceil/floor percentage thresholds, small sets, nested sets, and unsafe or impossible configurations.
- consensus observability or misbehavior detectors that only watch trusted participants or only the happy path. Hardening should cover untrusted reports, laggards, censorship suspicion, invalid proposals, and desync or catch-up transitions without changing consensus rules
- consensus-visible error, acknowledgement, receipt, precompile return, or result data built from raw errors or local diagnostics. These bytes must be deterministic protocol outputs if they can affect app hashes, results hashes, or replicated state
- view, round, timeout, or commit transitions where a certificate carries a lock, proposal identity, part-set header, or latest quorum state into the next step. Verify that state clearing, reconstruction, timeout vote emission, and commit handling preserve the certified identity rather than falling back to empty or stale local state
- verification predicates such as "needed", "current", "fresh", or "verified" must gate every later mutation derived from that object. Do not let stale or unnecessary certificates update ranges, headers, block matching, or emitted votes
- externally anchored chains, L2s, or hybrid consensus systems where local consensus depends on a base-chain sortition, checkpoint, epoch, reward set, or committee snapshot. Check that every block, signer-set, equivocation, and fork-choice lookup is bound to the canonical anchored context, not only a height or local hash.
- canonical-tip, safe-tip, or accepted-block caches that can be updated by lower-height, different-history, or stale validation results. Tip advancement should be monotonic within the same canonical history and should reject cross-history shortcuts.
- replay, repair, restart, and duplicate-slot code that marks a slot, block, payload, or fork as dead, duplicate, confirmed, repaired, safe, or voteable based on an older fork view. Recompute ancestry, root, repair origin, duplicate proof status, and current fork-choice constraints immediately before the label is stored or exposed.
- vote-generation, fork-switch, optimistic-confirmation, and tower or lockout paths where the target was selected under one view but emitted after bank/fork/root/duplicate state changed. The final vote sink should revalidate the exact target against the current fork and lockout rules.
- Recovered, repaired, reconstructed, erasure-decoded, or locally regenerated consensus objects that reach the same storage or replay sink as directly received objects. They should run the same feature-gated, fork-gated, metadata, completeness, parentage, and commitment checks unless the protocol explicitly defines a narrower exception.
- Multiple asynchronous or staged consensus validators whose results are merged before marking data valid, dead, duplicate, voteable, or safe. If the properties are independently required, failure from any branch must fail closed and must not be masked by success from another branch.
- equivocation or misbehavior evidence predicates that require too many fields to match. Evidence should match the protocol's definition of conflict, such as same parent, same sequence, same height or round, or mutually exclusive vote target, not just exact duplicate structure.
- fork upgrades that introduce a new transaction, payload, opcode, or runtime-visible domain value. Check that pre-fork rejection, post-fork field validation, payload-building rules, block-validation rules, and execution or runtime configuration all switch at the same authoritative fork coordinate.
- duplicate representations of consensus-visible values across headers, execution inputs, payload attributes, receipts, sidecars, fee metadata, fork flags, or replay records. For every fork/revision, require either one authoritative source or an explicit equality check before voting, execution, replay, or persistence.
- fields that are optional, zero, nil, absent, defaulted, or compatibility-filled in one revision but explicit in another. Check not only field presence, but also equality to the locally computed value and equality between duplicate representations.
- proposal builders that set execution-facing fields from one helper while validators check consensus-facing fields from another helper. Compare honest construction, receiver validation, replay, blocksync/recovery, synthetic block, and C++/native execution consumers.
- transaction validity rules that depend on header or fork fields. Verify the header value consumed by execution is the same value validated by consensus and block-policy affordability checks for every transaction type.

Questions to answer:
1. Which protocol rule is authoritative for this block, payload, fork, method version, chain variant, and timestamp or height?
2. Are all fields required by that rule present and checked before any canonical state update, payload build, or success response?
3. Does every equivalent entrypoint call the same canonical validator?
4. Do special-case or compatibility branches preserve core identity checks such as block hash, parent relation, state root, transaction root, receipt root, gas semantics, and fork-specific fields?
5. Can invalid ancestry, unknown head, inconsistent safe/finalized state, or known-invalid payload state be downgraded into syncing, generic error, or success?
6. If the protocol allows equal-strength competitors, is the tie-break deterministic and policy-correct, or is security-sensitive selection hidden inside randomness or a local heuristic?
7. For proposal/validation consensus, are proposal identity, prior state, transaction-set identity, signer identity, sequence, round, and active rules bound together at every acceptance and duplicate-suppression point?
8. Are quorum, threshold, and amendment or feature activation calculations safe at exact boundary fractions and small validator or committee sets?
9. Does every execution path that can affect the state root, receipt root, generated work, or fork-choice result journal and validate the same side effects as the canonical path?
10. For consensus-derived fields such as difficulty, weight, network ID, payload version, or rule domain, does the verifier recompute the expected value and reject mismatches rather than trusting the value carried by the producer?
11. Which fields are represented twice, and where is equality enforced for each active fork/revision?
12. If consensus validation uses a default or computed value, can execution consume a producer-supplied value for the same rule?

Severity guidance:
- High if malformed consensus data can be accepted as canonical, finalized, valid, or execution-ready.
- Medium for security hardening where validation is tightened in consensus-sensitive paths but exploitability or end-to-end reachability is not proven.
- Low for test-only, benchmark-only, or offline compatibility branches that cannot influence production validation.
