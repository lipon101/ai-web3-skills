# 🐝 Attack Surface Checklist (EVM + Solana)

**`━━━━⬡⬡⬡━━━━ SCOPING BEE ━━━━⬡⬡⬡━━━━`**

Comprehensive checklist for smart contract audit scoping. Each surface includes
trigger conditions — if any trigger matches, mark as `⚠️ INVESTIGATE`.

Use **Part A** for Solidity/EVM audits. Use **Part B** for Solana/Anchor audits.

> This checklist is used internally during scoping to inform complexity scoring
> and the prioritized audit hitlist. The full matrix is **not** included in the
> final scope report.

### ⬡ PART A — EVM (SOLIDITY) — 24 SURFACES ⬡

</div>

# Part A: EVM (Solidity)

---

## 1. Reentrancy (Same-Contract)

**Trigger conditions:**
- External calls before state updates (violates CEI)
- Missing `nonReentrant` modifier on functions that transfer ETH/tokens
- Callback patterns (ERC721 `onERC721Received`, ERC1155, `receive()`)

**What to check:**
- State-then-external-call ordering in every function
- Whether `nonReentrant` covers all entry points
- ETH transfers via `call{}()` without reentrancy guard

---

## 2. Reentrancy (Cross-Contract)

**Trigger conditions:**
- Contract A calls Contract B, which calls back to Contract A (or C)
- Shared state across multiple contracts
- Vault → Strategy → Pool callback chains

**What to check:**
- Cross-contract state dependencies
- Whether reentrancy locks are shared across interacting contracts
- Read-only reentrancy (Balancer-style: state inconsistency exploited by
  reading intermediate state)

---

## 3. Delegatecall / Proxy Patterns

**Trigger conditions:**
- `delegatecall` used anywhere
- Proxy pattern (Transparent, UUPS, Beacon, Diamond)
- `selfdestruct` in implementation

**What to check:**
- Storage layout compatibility between proxy and implementation
- Initialization vs constructor (uninitializable implementations)
- Function selector clashes (Diamond pattern)
- `selfdestruct` or `delegatecall` in implementation that can brick proxy

---

## 4. Authorization Bypass

**Trigger conditions:**
- Multiple roles with different permissions
- Missing access control on state-changing functions
- `tx.origin` usage
- Inconsistent modifier application across similar functions

**What to check:**
- Every `external`/`public` function has appropriate access control
- Privilege escalation paths (can user reach admin functions?)
- Modifier consistency: if `functionA` has `onlyOwner`, does the similar
  `functionB` also have it?
- `msg.sender` vs `tx.origin` confusion

---

## 5. ERC20 Non-Standard Behavior

**Trigger conditions:**
- Protocol accepts arbitrary ERC20 tokens
- No whitelist of supported tokens
- Comments mentioning "fee-on-transfer" or "rebasing"

**What to check:**
- Fee-on-transfer tokens: actual received amount != transfer amount
- Rebasing tokens: balance changes without transfer
- Missing return values: some tokens don't return `bool` on `transfer`
- Tokens with `decimals != 18`

- Multi-oracle inconsistency

---

## 7. Precision Loss / Rounding
