description: Audit and optimize tweets, X articles, and threads for X's recommendation algorithm. Use when user wants to review content before posting, improve engagement potential, or get algorithm-friendly suggestions. Triggers on /x-content-optimizer or requests to "review tweet", "optimize for X algorithm", "audit my post", or "improve engagement".

# X Optimizer

Audit content against X's recommendation algorithm (Phoenix/Grok-based) and provide optimization suggestions.

## Workflow

```
Input Content → Algorithm Audit → Issue Report → Fact Check → Suggested Revision → User Approval → Final Output
```

## Step 1: Receive Content

Accept content in any format:
- Direct text paste
- Markdown file
- Multiple tweets (thread)

Identify content type:
- **Single Tweet**: Under 280 chars, one post
- **X Article**: Long-form native content
- **Thread**: Multiple connected tweets

## Step 2: Algorithm Audit

Reference: [algorithm-rules.md](references/algorithm-rules.md)

### Audit Categories

**A. Positive Signal Potential**
| Signal | Check |
|--------|-------|
| Favorite | Emotional resonance or valuable insight? |
| Reply | Discussion hook or question? |
| Repost | Share-worthy content? |
| Dwell | Depth to hold attention? |
| Click | Curiosity-inducing hook? |

**B. Negative Signal Risk**
| Signal | Check |
|--------|-------|
| Not Interested | Relevant to target audience? |
| Mute/Block | Respectful, not spammy? |
| Report | Policy compliant? |

**C. Learned Penalties**
| Factor | Check |
|--------|-------|
| External Links | Core value IN content, not behind link? |
| Clickbait | Payoff matches promise? |

**D. Format & Structure**
- Hook strength (first line/50 chars)
- Content completeness
- Engagement driver (CTA/question)
- Readability (line breaks, emphasis)

## Step 3: Generate Audit Report

Format:
```
## Audit Report

### Score Summary
- Positive Signal Potential: [HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW]
- Negative Signal Risk: [HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW]
- Overall Algorithm Fit: [EXCELLENT/GOOD/NEEDS WORK/POOR]

### Issues Found
1. [Issue]: [Explanation]
   - Impact: [Which signal affected]
   - Fix: [Specific suggestion]

2. [Issue]: [Explanation]
   ...

### Strengths
- [What works well]
```

## Step 4: Fact Check

**CRITICAL**: Before adding or suggesting any factual information (numbers, dates, statistics, claims about products/companies), you MUST:

1. **Identify factual claims** in the content that need verification
2. **Search and verify** using WebSearch tool
3. **Only include verified facts** in the optimized version
4. **Remove or flag unverifiable claims** - never fabricate data

Examples requiring verification:
- Product launch dates ("X was released in...")
- Statistics ("X% of users...")
- Company announcements ("Company just launched...")
- Performance metrics ("reduces time by X%")

If no verifiable source exists, either:
- Remove the claim entirely
- Replace with qualitative language ("significantly improves" instead of fake percentages)
- Ask user if they have a source

## Step 5: Generate Optimized Version

Provide complete rewritten version addressing all issues.

Format:
```
## Optimized Version

[Full rewritten content]

### Changes Made
1. [Change]: [Why it improves algorithm score]
2. [Change]: [Why it improves algorithm score]
```

## Step 6: Offer One-Click Apply

If content is from a file:
```
Would you like me to apply these changes to the file?
```

If direct text:
```
Here's your optimized content ready to copy.
```

## Content-Specific Guidelines

### Single Tweet
- Hook in first 50 chars (preview visibility)
- Core value delivered completely
- End with engagement driver
- External links: provide context first

### X Article
- Title: curiosity + specific value
- Opening: validate the click
- Body: structured sections
- Closing: summary + CTA
- Advantage: keeps users on platform (dwell time)

### Thread
- Tweet 1: Standalone hook (must work alone)
- Tweet 2-3: Engagement point (question)
- Middle: Value delivery
- Final: CTA (repost, follow)
- Each tweet: Complete and independent

## Quick Reference

### High-Impact Improvements
1. Add question/discussion hook → ↑ Reply
2. Add quotable statement → ↑ Repost
3. Strengthen opening hook → ↑ Click, Dwell
4. Remove/contextualize external links → ↑ Dwell Time
5. Add specific data/examples → ↑ Credibility, Share

### Common Issues
| Issue | Impact | Fix |
|-------|--------|-----|
| Weak hook | Low click/dwell | Rewrite first line |
| Link-only value | User leaves platform | Add value IN content |
| No engagement driver | Low reply | Add question/CTA |
| Wall of text | Low dwell | Add line breaks |
| Off-topic | "Not interested" signal | Clarify audience fit |
