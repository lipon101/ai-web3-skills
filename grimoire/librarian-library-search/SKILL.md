  Semantic search across the librarian's indexed knowledge bases. This skill
  is invoked by the librarian agent when it needs to search local libraries
  by meaning rather than exact text. It runs a vector similarity query against
  the Qdrant database built by librarian-index and returns ranked results with
  source metadata for citation. Not user-invocable — called by the librarian
  agent as part of its research workflow.

# Librarian Library Search

Perform semantic search across indexed library content via a local Qdrant
vector database.

## When to Use

This skill is the librarian agent's primary method for consulting local
knowledge bases. Use it **before** falling back to grep-based file search.

Semantic search finds relevant content even when exact keywords don't match —
a query for "flash loan price manipulation" will surface content about oracle
attacks and sandwich attacks that grep would miss.

## How to Run

The search script is at `skills/librarian-library-search/scripts/search.py`
inside the plugin directory.

```bash
uv run /path/to/grimoire/skills/librarian-library-search/scripts/search.py \
    "your natural language query here"
```

### Flags

| Flag | Default | Description |
|------|---------|-------------|
| `--limit` | `5` | Maximum number of results |
| `--library` | *(all)* | Filter to a specific library name |

### Examples

```bash
# Broad search across all libraries
uv run .../search.py "reentrancy vulnerability in pull-payment pattern"

# Scoped to a single library
uv run .../search.py "access control bypass" --library smart-contract-vulnerabilities

# More results
uv run .../search.py "ERC-4626 share inflation" --limit 10
```

## Output Format

The script prints a JSON array to stdout. Each element has:

```json
{
  "score": 0.82,
  "content": "[library-name] path/to/file\n\n...chunk text...",
  "metadata": {
    "library": "smart-contract-vulnerabilities",
    "file": "vulnerabilities/reentrancy.md",
    "chunk_idx": 2,
    "source_url": "git@github.com:kadenzipfel/smart-contract-vulnerabilities.git"
  }
}
```

- **score** — cosine similarity (0–1). Results above 0.6 are typically relevant.
- **content** — the chunk text, prefixed with library name and file path.
- **metadata.file** and **metadata.source_url** — use these to construct
  navigable GitHub URLs for citations.

## Handling Failures

- **"Qdrant database not found"** — the index hasn't been built. Tell the
  user to run `librarian-index` and fall back to grep for now.
- **"Collection not found"** — same as above; the collection is created
  during indexing.
- **No results or all scores below 0.5** — the query may not match indexed
  content. Fall back to grep-based search of the library files.

## Guidelines

- **Limit to 1–2 calls per research question.** Reformulate the query if the
  first attempt returns poor results rather than making many calls.
- **Do not use for indexing.** This skill is read-only. Use `librarian-index`
  to build or rebuild the index.
- **Same embedding model required.** The search script must use the same
  FastEmbed model that was used during indexing (default:
  `sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2`). Do not change `--embedding_model`
  unless you also re-indexed with that model.
