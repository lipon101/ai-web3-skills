# KIT / Known Issue Triager

Use this skill when the task is to consolidate prior audit findings into a single known-issues register or to decide whether a new issue is already covered by that register.

## What This Skill Produces

- `known-issues.json`: canonical known-issues register used for both builds and duplicate checks

## When To Use The Script

Use the helper script whenever the task includes any of:

- multiple audit report files
- report URLs
- local audit directories or whole local repos
- GitHub repo URLs or GitHub folder URLs that contain audits
- regenerating `known-issues.json`
- checking a new issue against an existing known-issues file

Prefer the staged workflow over manual synthesis because it downloads remote artifacts, extracts text from PDFs, and keeps the final JSON register aligned with the prepared source state.

## Build Known Issues

For Claude-first extraction, use the staged workflow:

```bash
python3 claude-skill-kit/scripts/known_issues.py prepare-build \
  --input path/to/report-1.md \
  --input path/to/audits-folder \
  --input https://github.com/org/audit-repo/tree/main/reports \
  --merge-known known-issues.json \
  --state-file known-issues.json
```

Then:

1. Read `known-issues.json`
2. If `existing_issues_snapshot` is present, treat those as the current canonical register for extend mode
3. For each prepared source, read the normalized text file path listed there
4. Use Claude to fill `source_results` inside that same `known-issues.json`
5. Then use Claude to deduplicate both:
   - the new extracted issues from `source_results`
   - the existing canonical issues from `existing_issues_snapshot` when present
   into the final `canonical_issues` list inside that same `known-issues.json`
6. Finalize:

```bash
python3 claude-skill-kit/scripts/known_issues.py finalize-build \
  --state-file known-issues.json \
  --output known-issues.json
```

To extend an existing register instead of rebuilding from scratch:

```bash
python3 claude-skill-kit/scripts/known_issues.py finalize-build \
  --state-file known-issues.json \
  --merge-known known-issues.json \
  --output known-issues.json
```

Behavior:

- accepts repeated `--input` values for local paths and HTTP(S) URLs
- local directory inputs are expanded recursively into supported audit-like files
- GitHub repo and folder URLs are expanded into supported audit-like files before download
- downloads remote artifacts locally
- extracts PDF text before issue extraction
- supports Claude-first extraction through `prepare-build` and `finalize-build`
- uses a single reusable `known-issues.json` state file during the staged flow
- expects Claude to author the final `canonical_issues` list during staged builds, including deduping against `existing_issues_snapshot` during extend mode
- can either rebuild from scratch or extend an existing `known-issues.json`
- writes `known-issues.json`

## Check A New Issue

Use one of:

```bash
python3 claude-skill-kit/scripts/known_issues.py prepare-check \
  --known known-issues.json \
  --issue-file path/to/new-issue.md
```

Or:

```bash
python3 claude-skill-kit/scripts/known_issues.py prepare-check \
  --known known-issues.json \
  --issue-text "Unchecked return value in reward distributor can leave accounting inconsistent after external transfer failure."
```

Recommended staged check flow:

1. Run `prepare-check`.
2. Read the generated staged JSON.
3. Read `llm_contract` and follow it exactly.
4. Read `report_text` and identify the findings from that raw report text using the `finding_extraction` contract.
5. For each finding, do one model judgment against the full `known_issues` list using the `duplicate_check` contract.
6. If the host supports delegation and there are multiple findings, spawn one delegated worker per finding so the duplicate checks can run in parallel.
7. Give each worker one finding, the full `known_issues` list, the `duplicate_check` contract, and the finding's 1-based index.
8. Merge the worker outputs into one ordered result list sorted by `finding_index`.
9. Return one verdict per finding using the required output schema from `llm_contract`.

Behavior:

- `prepare-check` is required when checking one or more findings against the known register
- finding extraction during check mode is LLM-driven from `report_text`, not script-driven
- duplicate-check prompting is defined in `llm_contract` inside the staged JSON and should be followed exactly

## Operating Rules

- Treat `known-issues.json` as the only canonical artifact.
- Prefer Claude-assisted extraction for URLs, PDFs, GitHub-hosted reports, and irregular formats.
- Prefer Claude-assisted dedupe during staged builds: the model should decide which extracted issues collapse into one canonical issue and write that decision into `canonical_issues`.
- Prefer Claude-assisted duplicate checking through `prepare-check`: the model should review one finding at a time against the full known register.
- When multiple findings are present and delegation is available, spawning one worker per finding is required.
- Do not use deterministic fallback for build or check. If the staged LLM data is missing, fail instead of guessing.
- Collapse issues when the underlying root cause, affected surface, and impact are materially the same even if wording differs.
- Keep issues separate when they only share a component or severity but differ in bug class or exploit path.
- If extraction quality is weak for a source, record a warning instead of inventing structured findings.

## Expected Canonical Issue Fields

Each canonical issue should preserve:

- title
- summary
- root cause
- impact
- affected component
- aliases from source reports
- source report references
- source locations such as page or section when available
- evidence snippets when available

## Failure Handling

- If a URL cannot be fetched, surface the source and the fetch error.
- If a report yields weak or no structured candidates, keep going with the remaining sources and record that source as `partial` or `failed`.
- If a duplicate decision is borderline, return `possibly-known` and explain the ambiguity instead of forcing a collapse.
