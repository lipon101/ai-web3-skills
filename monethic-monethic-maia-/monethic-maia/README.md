# Monethic AI Auditor (MAIA)

Smart contract security audit engine. 192 detectors across EVM, Move-Aptos, and Move-Sui.

Created by [Monethic](https://monethic.io) | Coded by [0xluk3](https://x.com/0xluk3)

## Usage

### 1. Install

**Claude Code:**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Monethic/monethic-maia.git ~/.claude/skills/monethic_maia
```


### 2. Run

Run the skill:
```
/monethic_maia
```

**Codex:** invoke the skill:
```
$monethic-maia
```

### 3. Point at code

```
Point me to the code to audit, or press ENTER to use the current directory:
> /path/to/project
> ./src --exclude tests/ mocks/
```

### 4. Pick mode

MAIA auto-detects the platform and recommends detectors. Press ENTER to go, or:

```
go           run recommended detectors (default)
ALL          run all detectors for detected platform
NUCLEAR      run all detectors across all platforms
ACC LEND     pick specific categories
force:evm    override detected platform
```

### 5. Get report

Reports are saved to `report_maia_{timestamp}/`:

```
report_maia_20260317_143022/
  evm_audit.html          ← open in browser
  evm_audit.md            markdown version
  evm_audit_full.html     full report (includes false positives + downgrades)
  evm_audit_full.md       full markdown
```

MAIA outputs a clickable `file:///` link — paste it in your browser.

The `prompts/` directory also works standalone with any LLM that supports long context and file access.
