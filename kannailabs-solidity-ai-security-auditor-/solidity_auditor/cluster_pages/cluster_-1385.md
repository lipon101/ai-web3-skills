## Description
BuyerAgent can make two requests either `purchase` request or `StateUpdate` request.

First, he should make a `BuyerAgent::oraclePurchaseRequest()` request to buy all the items he needs, then call `BuyerAgent::purchase()` after His task gets completed by Oracle coordinator to buy the items he wants.

Then, in case of buying new items success he should make `BuyerAgent::oracleStateRequest()` to update his state after buying items, then call `BuyerAgent::updateState()` to change his state.

The problem here is that there is no check when `BuyerAgent::oraclePurchaseRequest()` or `BuyerAgent::oracleStateRequest()` get requested. There is just a check that enforces firing both of them on a given Phase.

We will explain the problem in the purchasing process, but it also existed in updating the state process.

When requesting to purchase items, we check that we are at a Round that is at Buy Phase, and when doing the actual purchase the Round should be the same as the Round we call `BuyerAgent::oraclePurchaseRequest()` as well as the phase should be `Buy`.

[swan/BuyerAgent.sol#L189-L195](https://github.com/Cyfrin/2024-10-swan-dria/blob/main/contracts/swan/BuyerAgent.sol#L189-L195) | [swan/BuyerAgent.sol#L222-L230](https://github.com/Cyfrin/2024-10-swan-dria/blob/main/contracts/swan/BuyerAgent.sol#L222-L230)
```solidity
    function oraclePurchaseRequest(bytes calldata _input, bytes calldata _models) external onlyAuthorized {
        // check that we are in the Buy phase, and return round
>>      (uint256 round,) = _checkRoundPhase(Phase.Buy);

>>      oraclePurchaseRequests[round] =
            swan.coordinator().request(SwanBuyerPurchaseOracleProtocol, _input, _models, swan.getOracleParameters());
    }
// -------------------
    function purchase() external onlyAuthorized {
        // check that we are in the Buy phase, and return round
>>      (uint256 round,) = _checkRoundPhase(Phase.Buy);

        // check if the task is already processed
        uint256 taskId = oraclePurchaseRequests[round];
>>      if (isOracleRequestProcessed[taskId]) {
            revert TaskAlreadyProcessed();
        }
    }
```

For `BuyerAgent::purchase()` to process, we should be at the same Round as well as at the Phas, which is `Buy` in that example, when we fired `BuyerAgent::oraclePurchaseRequest()`.

the flow is as follows:
1. BuyerAgent::oraclePurchaseRequest()
2. Generators will generate output in LLM Coordinator
3. Validators will validate in LLM Coordinator
4. Task marked as completed
5. BuyerAgent::purchase()

There is time will be taken for generators and validators to make the output (complete the task).

So if `BuyerAgent::oraclePurchaseRequest` gets fired before the end of `Buying` Phase with little time, this will make the Buy ends and enters `Withdraw` phase before Generators and Validaotrs Complete that task, resulting in losing Fees paid by the BuyerAgent when requesting the purchase request.

## Proof of Concept
- BuyerAgent wants to buy a given item
- His Round is `10` and we are at the Buy phase know
- The buying phase is about to end there is just one Hour left
- BuyerAgent Fired `BuyerAgent::oraclePurchaseRequest()`
- Fees got paid and we are waiting for the task to complete
- Generators and Validators took 6 Hours to complete this task
- Know, the BuyerAgent Round is `10` and the Phase is `Withdraw`
- calling `BuyerAgent::purchase()` will fail as we are not in the `Buy` Phase

The problem is that there is no time left for requesting and firing, if the request occur at the end of the Phase, finalizing the request either purach or update state will fail, as the phase will end.

We are doing Oracle and off-chain computations for the given task, and the time to finalize (complete) a task differs from one task to another according to difficulty.

There are three things here that make this problem occur.
1. If the Operator is not active, the `BuyerAgent` should call the request himself.
2. If Completing the Task process takes too much time, this can occur for Tasks that require a lot of validations, or difficulty is high
3. if there is a High Demand for a given request the Operator may finalize some of them at the end.

## Recommendations
Don't allow requests for all the phase ranges.

For example, In case we Have `7 days` for Buy phase, we should Stop requesting purchase requests at the end of `2 days` to not make requests occur at the last period of the phase resulting in an insolvable state if it gets completed after 2 days.

This is just an example. The period to stop requested should be determined according to the task itself (num of Generators/Validators needed and its difficulty).

### Example 2

**Auto Label:** **Improper state transition logic leading to operational dependency, service disruption, and governance ambiguity.**  

**Original Text Preview:**

The emergency upgrade process unfreezes the bridges and hyperchains through the `ProtocolUpgradeHandler` once the upgrade is executed. This is performed by invoking the internal [`_unfreeze` function](https://github.com/ZKsync-Association/zk-governance/blob/c66fc0b27ef7452188d349dafd8e170095bbd1f0/l1-contracts/src/ProtocolUpgradeHandler.sol#L331) which does not fire either of the `{Reinforce}Unfreeze` events. Thus, the contracts would resume to be operable without having emitted the respective event, besides emitting `EmergencyUpgradeExecuted`.


Consider emitting the `Unfreeze` event by adding it to the emergency upgrade function. Alternatively, consider making the code more self\-contained by having the emergency board calling the [`unfreeze` function](https://github.com/ZKsync-Association/zk-governance/blob/c66fc0b27ef7452188d349dafd8e170095bbd1f0/l1-contracts/src/ProtocolUpgradeHandler.sol#L474) separately after the upgrade execution.


***Update:** Resolved at commit [8b62b1c](https://github.com/ZKsync-Association/zk-governance/commits/8b62b1c527fabad105d6b634a1415198bd388f6c).*

### Example 3

**Auto Label:** **Improper state transition logic leading to operational dependency, service disruption, and governance ambiguity.**  

**Original Text Preview:**

There are two functions, namely [`unfreeze()`](https://github.com/ZKsync-Association/zk-governance/blob/c66fc0b27ef7452188d349dafd8e170095bbd1f0/l1-contracts/src/ProtocolUpgradeHandler.sol#L484-L488) and [`reinforceUnfreeze()`](https://github.com/ZKsync-Association/zk-governance/blob/c66fc0b27ef7452188d349dafd8e170095bbd1f0/l1-contracts/src/ProtocolUpgradeHandler.sol#L484), that anyone can call to unfreeze all hyperchains after the block timestamp passes the `protocolFrozenUntil` value.


However, depending on which of these two functions are called, there could be confusion in `freezeStatus` as well as events emitted.


* When `unfreeze()` is called, the `freezeStatus` is reset to `None`, the `protocolFrozenUntil` is reset to `0`, and an `Unfreeze()` event is emitted.
* When `reinforceUnfreeze()` is called, the `freezeStatus` remains as it is, which could be `Soft` or `Hard` despite it has been unfrozen, and `protocolFrozenUntil` remains as it is with a `ReinforceFreeze()` event emitted.


Thus there are two paths for performing the same functionality, but with different state variable updates and event emissions. Consider only allowing one path for anyone to unfreeze after the expiration timestamp for operational clarity and consistency.


***Update:** Partially resolved at commit [15831c6](https://github.com/ZKsync-Association/zk-governance/commits/15831c60e25f6375eeb99b0c75d13cfec29cedf7). The ZKsync Association team stated:*



> *Fixed. We decided to keep two functions but restrict unfreeze to happen only once.*
