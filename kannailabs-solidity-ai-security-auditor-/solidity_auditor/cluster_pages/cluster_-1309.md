# Cluster -1309

**Rank:** #384  
**Count:** 14  

## Label
Redundant loops and repeated state changes or validations repeatedly touch storage and conduct unnecessary calls, inflating gas consumption and degrading transaction performance without altering correctness.

## Cluster Information
- **Total Findings:** 14

## Examples

### Example 1

**Auto Label:** Redundant validation checks consume excessive gas due to unnecessary state reads, leading to inefficient execution without functional impact.  

**Original Text Preview:**

##### Description
An issue has been spotted in the `removeAllowedWithdrawalToken` function of the `UsrRedemptionExtension` contract. This function unnecessarily checks the validity of the `_allowedWithdrawalTokenAddress` twice, first through a modifier and then directly in the function body itself. While this does not pose a direct security risk, it is considered as a wasteful operation that could potentially increase gas cost.

##### Recommendation
We recommend removing the redundant security check for `_allowedWithdrawalTokenAddress`.

### Example 2

**Auto Label:** Inefficient loop structures leading to high gas costs and poor scalability due to excessive iterations, redundant operations, and lack of optimization.  

**Original Text Preview:**

**Severity**: Low

**Status**: Resolved

**Description**

There are multiple instances of loops in the codebase that iterate over potentially large datasets, E.g. insertVestingList, insertWalletListToVesting, removeWalletListFromVesting, insertAdminList, removeAdminList. Excessive use of loops can lead to high gas costs and inefficient execution, especially when dealing with large amounts of data. This can result in performance issues and may even cause transactions to fail due to gas limit exceedance.

**Recommendation**:

Optimize loops by reducing their frequency and considering alternative methods.

### Example 3

**Auto Label:** Redundant validation checks consume excessive gas due to unnecessary state reads, leading to inefficient execution without functional impact.  

**Original Text Preview:**

##### Description
The issue was identified within the [`exerciseTokenOption`](https://github.com/MetaLex-Tech/MetaVesT/blob/b614405e60bce8b852e46d06c03fd47b04d86dde/src/TokenOptionAllocation.sol#L147) function of the `TokenOptionAllocation` contract. There is an unnecessary check for the `msg.sender` token balance, as there are usually checks on the token contract side, and if the user's balance is insufficient, the transaction will revert.

The issue is classified as **Low** severity because it introduces unnecessary gas expenditure.

##### Recommendation
We recommend removing the mentioned check.
