## Examples

### Example 1

**Auto Label:** Failure to validate asset balances before initiating withdrawals, leading to reverts due to zero-amount validation checks in lending protocols.  

**Original Text Preview:**

**Severity:** Low

**Path:** src/stHYPEWithdrawalModule.sol#L312

**Description:** [AAVE V3 Pool](https://github.com/aave/aave-v3-core/blob/782f51917056a53a2c228701058a6c3fb233684a/contracts/protocol/libraries/logic/ValidationLogic.sol#L66-L71) reverts when withdrawing zero amount:
```
function validateWithdraw(
    DataTypes.ReserveCache memory reserveCache,
    uint256 amount,
    uint256 userBalance
  ) internal view {
    require(amount != 0, Errors.INVALID_AMOUNT);
```
Thus, when updating a lending module (`AaveLendingModule.sol`) with `assetBalance() = 0` via `stHYPEWithdrawalModule::setProposedLendingModule` it will revert:
```
if (address(lendingModule) != address(0)) {
    lendingModule.withdraw(lendingModule.assetBalance(), address(this));
}
```
```
function setProposedLendingModule() external onlyOwner {
    if (lendingModuleProposal.startTimestamp > block.timestamp) {
        revert stHYPEWithdrawalModule__setProposedLendingModule_ProposalNotActive();
    }

    if (lendingModuleProposal.startTimestamp == 0) {
        revert stHYPEWithdrawalModule__setProposedLendingModule_InactiveProposal();
    }

    if (address(lendingModule) != address(0)) {
        lendingModule.withdraw(lendingModule.assetBalance(), address(this));
    }

    lendingModule = ILendingModule(lendingModuleProposal.lendingModule);
    delete lendingModuleProposal;
    emit LendingModuleSet(address(lendingModule));
}
```

**Remediation:**  Consider checking the `assetBalance()` to not being 0 before calling `lendingModule.withdraw()` inside `stHYPEWithdrawalModule::setProposedLendingModule`.

For example:
```
if (address(lendingModule) != address(0) && lendingModule.assetBalance() != 0) {
    lendingModule.withdraw(lendingModule.assetBalance(), address(this));
}
```

**Status:** Fixed

### Summary

The `reallocate()` function is the primary way a curated vault can remove liquidity from an underlying pool, so being unable to fully remove the liquidity is problematic. However, due to a logic issue in the implementation, any attempt to `reallocate()` liquidity in a pool to zero will revert. 

### Root Cause

The function `CuratedVault::reallocate()` is callable by an allocator and reallocates funds between underlying pools. As shown below, `toWithdraw` is the difference between `supplyAssets` (total assets in the underlying pool controlled by the curated vault) and the `allocation.assets` which is the target allocation for this pool. Therefore, if `toWithdraw` is greater than zero, a withdrawal is required from that pool:

```javascript
  function reallocate(MarketAllocation[] calldata allocations) external onlyAllocator {
    uint256 totalSupplied;
    uint256 totalWithdrawn;

    for (uint256 i; i < allocations.length; ++i) {
      MarketAllocation memory allocation = allocations[i];
      IPool pool = allocation.market;

      (uint256 supplyAssets, uint256 supplyShares) = _accruedSupplyBalance(pool);
@>    uint256 toWithdraw = supplyAssets.zeroFloorSub(allocation.assets);

      if (toWithdraw > 0) {
        if (!config[pool].enabled) revert CuratedErrorsLib.MarketNotEnabled(pool);

        // Guarantees that unknown frontrunning donations can be withdrawn, in order to disable a market.
        uint256 shares;
        if (allocation.assets == 0) {
          shares = supplyShares;
@>        toWithdraw = 0;
        }

@>      DataTypes.SharesType memory burnt = pool.withdrawSimple(asset(), address(this), toWithdraw, 0);
        emit CuratedEventsLib.ReallocateWithdraw(_msgSender(), pool, burnt.assets, burnt.shares);
        totalWithdrawn += burnt.assets;
      } else {
        
        ... SKIP!...
      }
    }
```

The issue arrises when for any given pool, `allocation.assets` is set to 0, meaning the allocator wishes to empty that pool and allocate the liquidity to another pool. Under this scenario, `toWithdraw` is set to 0, and passed into `Pool::withdrawSimple()`. This is a logic mistake to attempt to withdraw 0 instead of the `supplyAssets` when attempting to withdraw all liquidity to a pool. The call will revert due to a [check](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-06-new-scope/blob/main/zerolend-one/contracts/core/pool/logic/ValidationLogic.sol#L97) in the pool's withdraw flow that ensures the amount being withdrawn is greater than 0.

It seems this bug is a result of forking the Metamorpho codebase which [implements the same logic](https://github.com/morpho-org/metamorpho/blob/cc6b01610c9b0000d965faef705e1670859d9c0f/src/MetaMorpho.sol#L382-L389). However, Metamorpho's underlying withdraw() function [can take either an asset amount or share amount](https://github.com/morpho-org/morpho-blue/blob/0448402af51b8293ed36653de43cbee8d4d2bfda/src/Morpho.sol#L216-L217), but ZeroLend's `Pool::withdrawSimple()` only [accepts an amount of assets](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-06-new-scope/blob/main/zerolend-one/contracts/core/pool/Pool.sol#L94). 

### Internal pre-conditions

1. A curated vault having more than 1 underlying pool in the `supplyQueue`

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

1. A curated vault is setup with more than 1 underlying pool in the `supplyQueue`
2. An allocator wishes to reallocate all the supplied liquidity from one pool to another
3. The allocator calls constructs the array of `MarketAllocation` withdrawing all liquidity from the first pool and depositing the same amount to the second pool
4. The action fails due to the described bug

### Impact

- Allocators cannot remove all liquidity in a pool throuhg the `reallocate()` function. The natspec comments indicate that emptying a pool to zero through the `reallocate()` function is the [first step of the intended way to remove a pool](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-06-new-scope/blob/main/zerolend-one/contracts/interfaces/vaults/ICuratedVaultBase.sol#L141-L142).  

### PoC

Paste and run the below test in /test/forge/core/vaults/. It shows a simple 2-pool vault with a single depositors. An allocator attempts to reallocate the liquidity in the first pool to the second pool, but reverts due to the described issue.

```javascript

  }

  function test_POC_AllocatorCannotReallocateToZero() public {

    // 1. supplier supplies to underlying pool through curated vault
    uint256 assets = 10e18;
    loanToken.mint(supplier, assets);

    vm.startPrank(supplier);
    uint256 shares = vault.deposit(assets, onBehalf);
    vm.stopPrank();

    // 2. Allocator attempts to reallocate all of these funds to another pool
    MarketAllocation[] memory allocations = new MarketAllocation[](2);
    
    allocations[0] = MarketAllocation({
        market: vault.supplyQueue(0),
        assets: 0
    });

    // Fill in the second MarketAllocation struct
    allocations[1] = MarketAllocation({
        market: vault.supplyQueue(1),
        assets: assets
    });

    vm.startPrank(allocator);
    vm.expectRevert("NOT_ENOUGH_AVAILABLE_USER_BALANCE");
    vault.reallocate(allocations); // Reverts due to attempting a withdrawal amount of 0
  }
}
```

### Mitigation

The comment "Guarantees that unknown frontrunning donations can be withdrawn, in order to disable a market" does not seem to apply to Zerolend pools as a donation to the pool would not disable the market, nor would it affect the amount of assets the curated vault can withdraw from the underlying pool. With this in mind, Metamorpho's safety check can be removed:

```diff
  function reallocate(MarketAllocation[] calldata allocations) external onlyAllocator {
    uint256 totalSupplied;
    uint256 totalWithdrawn;


    for (uint256 i; i < allocations.length; ++i) {
      MarketAllocation memory allocation = allocations[i];
      IPool pool = allocation.market;

      (uint256 supplyAssets, uint256 supplyShares) = _accruedSupplyBalance(pool);
      uint256 toWithdraw = supplyAssets.zeroFloorSub(allocation.assets);

      if (toWithdraw > 0) {
        if (!config[pool].enabled) revert CuratedErrorsLib.MarketNotEnabled(pool);


-       // Guarantees that unknown frontrunning donations can be withdrawn, in order to disable a market.
-       uint256 shares;
-       if (allocation.assets == 0) {
-         shares = supplyShares;
-         toWithdraw = 0;
-       }

        DataTypes.SharesType memory burnt = pool.withdrawSimple(asset(), address(this), toWithdraw, 0);
        emit CuratedEventsLib.ReallocateWithdraw(_msgSender(), pool, burnt.assets, burnt.shares);
        totalWithdrawn += burnt.assets;
      } else {
        uint256 suppliedAssets =
          allocation.assets == type(uint256).max ? totalWithdrawn.zeroFloorSub(totalSupplied) : allocation.assets.zeroFloorSub(supplyAssets);

        if (suppliedAssets == 0) continue;

        uint256 supplyCap = config[pool].cap;
        if (supplyCap == 0) revert CuratedErrorsLib.UnauthorizedMarket(pool);

        if (supplyAssets + suppliedAssets > supplyCap) revert CuratedErrorsLib.SupplyCapExceeded(pool);

        // The market's loan asset is guaranteed to be the vault's asset because it has a non-zero supply cap.
        IERC20(asset()).forceApprove(address(pool), type(uint256).max);
        DataTypes.SharesType memory minted = pool.supplySimple(asset(), address(this), suppliedAssets, 0);
        emit CuratedEventsLib.ReallocateSupply(_msgSender(), pool, minted.assets, minted.shares);
        totalSupplied += suppliedAssets;
      }
    }

    if (totalWithdrawn != totalSupplied) revert CuratedErrorsLib.InconsistentReallocation();
  }
```

### Example 3

**Auto Label:** Failure to validate zero withdrawal amounts leads to reverts during emergency or reallocation, locking funds due to improper input checks and inadequate handling of empty positions.  

**Original Text Preview:**

<https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-02-ethos/blob/73687f32b934c9d697b97745356cdf8a1f264955/Ethos-Vault/contracts/abstract/ReaperBaseStrategyv4.sol#L109><br>
<https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-02-ethos/blob/73687f32b934c9d697b97745356cdf8a1f264955/Ethos-Vault/contracts/ReaperStrategyGranarySupplyOnly.sol#L200>

`ReaperBaseStrategyv4.harvest()` might revert in an emergency if there is no position on the lending pool.

As a result, the funds might be locked inside the strategy.

### Proof of Concept

The main problem is that [Aave lending pool doesn't allow 0 withdrawals](https://github.com/aave/protocol-v2/blob/554a2ed7ca4b3565e2ceaea0c454e5a70b3a2b41/contracts/protocol/libraries/logic/ValidationLogic.sol#L60-L70).

```solidity
  function validateWithdraw(
    address reserveAddress,
    uint256 amount,
    uint256 userBalance,
    mapping(address => DataTypes.ReserveData) storage reservesData,
    DataTypes.UserConfigurationMap storage userConfig,
    mapping(uint256 => address) storage reserves,
    uint256 reservesCount,
    address oracle
  ) external view {
    require(amount != 0, Errors.VL_INVALID_AMOUNT);
```

So the below scenario would be possible.

1.  After depositing and withdrawing from the Aave lending pool, the current position is 0 and the strategy is in debt.
2.  It's possible that the strategy has some want balance in the contract but no position on the lending pool. It's because `_adjustPosition()` remains the debt during reinvesting and also, there is an `authorizedWithdrawUnderlying()` for `STRATEGIST` to withdraw from the lending pool.
3. If the strategy is in an emergency, `harvest()` tries to liquidate all positions(=0 actually) and it will revert because of 0 withdrawal from Aave.
4. Also, `withdraw()` will revert at [L98](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-02-ethos/blob/73687f32b934c9d697b97745356cdf8a1f264955/Ethos-Vault/contracts/abstract/ReaperBaseStrategyv4.sol#L98) as the strategy is in the debt.

As a result, the funds might be locked inside the strategy unless the `emergency` mode is canceled.

### Recommended Mitigation Steps

We should check 0 withdrawal in `_withdrawUnderlying()`.

```solidity
    function _withdrawUnderlying(uint256 _withdrawAmount) internal {
        uint256 withdrawable = balanceOfPool();
        _withdrawAmount = MathUpgradeable.min(_withdrawAmount, withdrawable);

        if(_withdrawAmount != 0) {
            ILendingPool(ADDRESSES_PROVIDER.getLendingPool()).withdraw(address(want), _withdrawAmount, address(this));
        }
    }
```

 > Valid edge case in as far as harvests would fail. However, funds won't get locked in the strategy. They can still be withdrawn through an appropriate withdraw() TX. Recommend downgrading to low since this is purely about state handling without putting any assets at risk. See screenshot below for simulation:
