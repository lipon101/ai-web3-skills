# Cluster -1092

**Rank:** #112  
**Count:** 152  

## Label
Lack of validation for fee parameter updates lets unauthenticated actors supply malicious values that bypass intended fee checks, enabling unauthorized fee redirection, revenue drains, or unfair transaction economics.

## Examples

### Example 1

**Auto Label:** Missing input or state validation leads to exploitable fee or parameter manipulation, enabling incorrect logic, overflow, or unfair economic outcomes.  

**Original Text Preview:**

In the `updateFeeToken`, `updateFeeAmount`, and `updateFeeTo` functions, the fee config is not checked to ensure it has been properly set beforehand. As a result, an editor could mistakenly update the fee config for a chain ID where the fee config has not been set.

Example of impact: If the editor updates the fee token, the fee config could not be set for that chain ID.

### Example 2

**Auto Label:** Missing or flawed fee validation leads to unauthorized fee setting, incorrect fee calculation, or denial-of-service, enabling economic manipulation or transaction failure.  

**Original Text Preview:**

**Description:** Currently the protocol allows users to over-pay:
```solidity
function _revertIfInsufficientFee() internal view {
    if (msg.value < _getFee()) revert SoulBoundToken__InsufficientFee();
}
```

Consider changing this to require the exact fee to prevent users from accidentally over-paying:
```solidity
function _revertIfIncorrectFee() internal view {
    if (msg.value != _getFee()) revert SoulBoundToken__IncorrectFee();
}
```

[Fat Finger](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fat-finger_error) errors have previously resulted in notorious unintended errors in financial markets; the protocol could choose to be defensive and help protect users from themselves.

### Example 3

**Auto Label:** Insufficient input validation and bounds checking enable attackers to manipulate or nullify fees, leading to loss of value, unauthorized fee redirection, or system failure through improper parameter handling.  

**Original Text Preview:**

**Description:** `PolygonStrategy::addFee` does not check if `_feeBasisPoints > 0` when adding a new fee element to the `fees` array. This is inconsistent with the `PolygonStrategy::updateFee` logic where `_feeBasisPoints = 0` triggers a removal of the fee element from the `fees` array.

**Recommended Mitigation:** Consider introducing a non-zero check to `_feeBasisPoints`.
