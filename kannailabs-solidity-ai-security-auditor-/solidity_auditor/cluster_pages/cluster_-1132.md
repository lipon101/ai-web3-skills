# Cluster -1132

**Rank:** #296  
**Count:** 25  

## Label
Failing to validate or sanitize user-controlled source strings before incorporating them into dialogs, sandboxed code, or ACLs lets attackers inject spoofed payloads that mislead users, alter behavior, and risk unauthorized transactions or outages.

## Cluster Information
- **Total Findings:** 25

## Examples

### Example 1

**Auto Label:** Improper input sanitization leads to malicious content injection, enabling phishing, UI spoofing, and unauthorized transaction execution through untrusted data rendering.  

**Original Text Preview:**

## Snap Module Security Advisory

The Snap module allows interaction with users via confirmation dialogs for sensitive actions. However, improper handling of newline characters ( `\n` or `\r` ) in these dialogs may result in spoofing or phishing attacks. Newlines inject additional lines of text into the dialog box displayed to the user, creating a misleading appearance and tricking the user into believing the dialog contains genuine warnings or instructions. This may prompt users to take unsafe actions, such as approving transactions or granting access to their accounts.

## Remediation

Strip all newline characters ( `\n` , `\r` ) from inputs displayed in dialogs.

## Patch

Fixed in `7911177`.

### Example 2

**Auto Label:** Insufficient input validation leads to unauthorized data manipulation, financial loss, or system compromise through malformed or malicious inputs exploiting parsing and cryptographic weaknesses.  

**Original Text Preview:**

## Validate Source

`validateSource` checks the entire function (before + sesCompatibleSource + after). However, if `sesCompatibleSource` is manipulated, it may be possible to inject malicious code, which may break out of the sandbox if it is crafted in a specific way (such as closing `with()` statements or escaping contexts).

## Remediation

Validate `sesCompatibleSource` separately to ensure it contains only valid code and does not include malicious injections before it gets combined with the rest of the function. Additionally, enable the `runChecks` flag by default, ensuring that these validation checks are always performed.

## Diﬃculty: High

## Type: Data Validation

## Description
The IP address used to create Redpanda ACLs is not validated, which allows bypassing the host restriction from ACLs (Figure 7.1). Because the IP address can be an arbitrary string, it is possible to send an all hosts wildcard (*) instead of a concrete IP address.

```python
def create_acls(self, username: str, ip_address: str):
    """Create ACLs in redpanda for user."""
    self.logger.info("Creating ACLs")
    admin_client = KafkaAdminClient(bootstrap_servers=self.config.event_bus_brokers)
    read_acl = ACL(
        principal=f"User:{username}",
        host=ip_address,
        operation=ACLOperation.READ,
        permission_type=ACLPermissionType.ALLOW,
        resource_pattern=ResourcePattern(ResourceType.TOPIC, DATA_FRAME_TOPICS),
    )
    write_acl = ACL(
        principal=f"User:{username}",
        host=ip_address,
        operation=ACLOperation.WRITE,
        permission_type=ACLPermissionType.ALLOW,
        resource_pattern=ResourcePattern(ResourceType.TOPIC, ORDER_PROPOSAL_TOPICS),
    )
```

**Figure 7.1:** Unvalidated IP address ends up straight in ACLs  
(elixir-protocol-api/app/api/services/auth.py#L125-L144)

## Exploit Scenario
A malicious strategy executor sends a * instead of a concrete IP address to verify an endpoint. They use the Redpanda credentials to execute a distributed denial-of-service attack.

## Recommendations
Short term, require the IP address sent by strategy executors to be a concrete value, or take the IP address from the connection instead of the user having to provide it.
