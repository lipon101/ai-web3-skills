### Example 1

**Auto Label:** Flash loan vulnerabilities enabling unauthorized asset manipulation, fee bypass, or supply overdraw through flawed validation, precision errors, or improper recipient checks.  

**Original Text Preview:**

**Impact**
The code for the Balancer Vault Flashloan is as follows:

https://etherscan.io/address/0xba12222222228d8ba445958a75a0704d566bf2c8#code

```solidity
   function flashLoan(
        IFlashLoanRecipient recipient,
        IERC20[] memory tokens,
        uint256[] memory amounts,
        bytes memory userData
    ) external override nonReentrant whenNotPaused {
        InputHelpers.ensureInputLengthMatch(tokens.length, amounts.length);

        uint256[] memory feeAmounts = new uint256[](tokens.length);
        uint256[] memory preLoanBalances = new uint256[](tokens.length);

        // Used to ensure `tokens` is sorted in ascending order, which ensures token uniqueness.
        IERC20 previousToken = IERC20(0);

        for (uint256 i = 0; i < tokens.length; ++i) {
            IERC20 token = tokens[i];
            uint256 amount = amounts[i];

            _require(token > previousToken, token == IERC20(0) ? Errors.ZERO_TOKEN : Errors.UNSORTED_TOKENS);
            previousToken = token;

            preLoanBalances[i] = token.balanceOf(address(this));
            feeAmounts[i] = _calculateFlashLoanFeeAmount(amount);

            _require(preLoanBalances[i] >= amount, Errors.INSUFFICIENT_FLASH_LOAN_BALANCE);
            token.safeTransfer(address(recipient), amount);
        }

        recipient.receiveFlashLoan(tokens, amounts, feeAmounts, userData);
```

Meaning anyone can call this and set the `BalancerFlashloan` as the recipient

This only check done in the Zappers looks as follows:

https://github.com/liquity/bold/blob/57c2f13fe78f914cab3d9736f73b4e0ffc58e022/contracts/src/Zappers/LeverageWETHZapper.sol#L165-L168

```solidity
    function receiveFlashLoanOnLeverDownTrove(LeverDownTroveParams calldata _params, uint256 _effectiveFlashLoanAmount)
        external
    {
        require(msg.sender == address(flashLoanProvider), "LZ: Caller not FlashLoan provider");
```

Which means that any arbitrary flashloan can be made to trigger the callbacks specified in `receiveFlashLoan`

This opens up to the following:

**We can do the FL on behalf of other people and cause them to unwind or take on more debt**

Since balancer removed the flashloan fee


This can be abused to alter a user position:
- Force them to take leverage or to unwind their position

And can also be used to steal funds from the user by:
- Imbalancing swap pool
- Having user alter their position and take a loss / more debt than intended

The loss will be taken by the victim in the form of a "imbalanced" leverage

Whereas the attacker will skim the sandwhiched funds to themselves



**Proof Of Code**

- Call `flashLoanProvider.makeFlashLoan` with malicious inputs
OR
- Call Vault.flashloan with malicious inputs

**Mitigation**

Enforce that all calls are started by the Zaps (trusted contracts)

You could generate a transient id for the operation, and verify that the only accepted callback is the trusted one

**Pseudocode**

```solidity
    function receiveFlashLoanOnOpenLeveragedTrove(
        OpenLeveragedTroveParams calldata _params,
        uint256 _effectiveFlashLoanAmount
    ) external {
        require(msg.sender == address(flashLoanProvider), "LZ: Caller not FlashLoan provider");
        require(decodeParams(_params) == currentOperationId, "callback was started by this contract");
        currentOperationId = UNSET_OPERATION_ID; // bytes32(0)
```

**Original Text Preview:**

**Impact**
These 3 lines can be VERY dangerous

https://github.com/GalloDaSballo/quill-review/blob/8d6e4c8ed0759cea1ff0376db9fd55db864cd7e8/contracts/src/Zappers/Modules/FlashLoans/BalancerFlashLoan.sol#L46-L52

```solidity
        // This will be used by the callback below no
        receiver = IFlashLoanReceiver(msg.sender);

        vault.flashLoan(this, tokens, amounts, userData);

        // Reset receiver
        receiver = IFlashLoanReceiver(address(0));
```

The reason why this code is safe for BOLD is becasue `vault` has a Reentrancy guard

In lack of that guard many projects can get exploited

**Theoretical Proof Of Code**

https://gist.github.com/GalloDaSballo/a4dd8c2b77a64d602983152d621f55c3

**Theoretical Mitigation**

- Validate AAVE initiator
- Consume the receiver

```solidity
    function receiveFlashLoan(
        IERC20[] calldata tokens,
        uint256[] calldata amounts,
        uint256[] calldata feeAmounts,
        bytes calldata userData
    ) external override {
        require(msg.sender == address(vault), "Caller is not Vault");
        require(address(receiver) != address(0), "Flash loan not properly initiated");

        // NOTE: Validate initiator (if available) (e.g. AAVE)
        // NOTE: Why not consume receiver?
        IFlashLoanReceiver public cachedReceiver = receiver;
        receiver = IFlashLoanReceiver(address(0));
```

## Vulnerability Report: Double Upscaling in pay_flashloan

## Description

The vulnerability arises from double upscaling during the repayment process in `pay_flashloan` when handling meta-stable pools. Specifically, `pay_flashloan` upscales `balance_after_flashloan` twice. When handling meta-stable pools, the funds are multiplied by their value derived from an oracle. As a result, the post-repayment invariant computation utilizes an incorrectly scaled value.

## Code Snippet

> _ thalaswap_v2/sources/pool.move rust

```rust
public fun pay_flashloan(assets: vector<FungibleAsset>, loan: Flashloan) acquires PauseFlag,
,→ Pool, MetaStablePool, StablePool, ThalaSwap, WeightedPool {
    [...]
    if (pool_is_metastable(pool_obj)) {
        borrow_amounts = upscale_metastable_amounts(pool_obj, borrow_amounts);
        balances = upscale_metastable_amounts(pool_obj, pool_balances(pool_obj));
    };
    [...]
    while (i < len) {
        let repay_sub_fees = *vector::borrow(&repay_amounts, i) - *vector::borrow(&fee_amounts,
        ,→ i);
        let balance_after_flashloan = *vector::borrow(&balances, i) + repay_sub_fees;
        vector::push_back(&mut balances_after_flashloan, balance_after_flashloan);
        i = i + 1;
    };
    [...]
    if (pool_is_metastable(pool_obj)) {
        balances_after_flashloan = upscale_metastable_amounts(pool_obj,
        ,→ balances_after_flashloan);
    };
    [...]
}
```

Consequently, this creates a discrepancy where the post-repayment invariant (`curr_invariant`) appears larger than the pre-repayment invariant (`prev_invariant`), even if no real repayment has occurred. This incorrect invariant validation allows the flashloan repayment to proceed without properly verifying the adequacy of the repayment. Thus, the pool may accept a repayment that is less than the borrowed amount, resulting in a loss of funds.

## Remediation

Eliminate the double upscaling to prevent inflation of the `curr_invariant`.

## Patch

Fixed in commit `19dc5f1`.
