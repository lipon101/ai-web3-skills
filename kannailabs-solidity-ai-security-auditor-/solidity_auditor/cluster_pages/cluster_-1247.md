# Cluster -1247

**Rank:** #269  
**Count:** 31  

## Label
Omitting the NFT transfer to the buy order creator once sellNFT completes leaves ownership trapped in the buyOrder contract, causing creators to lose their NFTs and allowing unauthorized parties to retain asset control.

## Cluster Information

## Examples

### Example 1

**Auto Label:** Inadequate authorization checks in NFT ownership and transfer logic enable unauthorized access, asset control, or fund theft through flawed validation of sender, receiver, or operator roles.

## Security Risk in Transaction Authorization

The current implementation allows the user to sign and submit transactions (`signAndSubmitTransaction`) without explicitly displaying or simulating transaction parameters. This lack of transparency creates a significant risk that a user might unknowingly authorize a malicious or fraudulent transaction, potentially compromising their account or funds.

## Code Snippet

```typescript
export const onRpcRequest: OnRpcRequestHandler = async ({
  origin,
  request,
}) => {
  [...]
  case 'signAndSubmitTransaction': {
    const account = await getAccount();
    const result = await snap.request({
      method: 'snap_dialog',
      params: {
        type: 'confirmation',
        content: (
          <Box>
            <Text>
              <Bold>{origin}</Bold> wants to sign a transaction
            </Text>
            <Text>
              using <Bold>{account.accountAddress.toString()}</Bold> account
            </Text>
            <Text>Confirm to sign this transaction.</Text>
          </Box>
        ),
      },
    });
    [...]
  }
  [...]
}
```

## Remediation

Display the transaction parameters before confirmation, or simulate the transaction’s execution and show a summary of its expected outcome to help users understand its effects.

## Patch

Fixed in `de5a944`. Nightly is also committing to introduce a full simulation.

### Example 2

**Auto Label:** Insufficient ownership and authorization checks enable unauthorized asset manipulation, leading to loss of control, unauthorized transfers, and potential theft through improper validation of caller identity or transaction order.

### Summary

After sellNFT is completed, the NFT should be transferred  to the order creator, but this is not done.

### Root Cause

After the buyOrder is completed, the order creator does not receive the NFT, and the NFT is sent directly to **[buyOrderContract](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-debita-finance-v3/blob/1465ba6884c4cc44f7fc28e51f792db346ab1e33/Debita-V3-Contracts/contracts/buyOrders/buyOrder.sol#L99)**

The latter only emits an event and deletes the order, but does not transfer the NFT to  the order creator

### Internal pre-conditions



### External pre-conditions

1. User A  create buyOrder.
2. User B  **sellNFT**.

### Attack Path
1. User A  create buyOrder.
2. User B  **sellNFT**,and [receive](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-debita-finance-v3/blob/1465ba6884c4cc44f7fc28e51f792db346ab1e33/Debita-V3-Contracts/contracts/buyOrders/buyOrder.sol#L122) **buyToken**
3.  But **order creator** will[ lose ](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-debita-finance-v3/blob/1465ba6884c4cc44f7fc28e51f792db346ab1e33/Debita-V3-Contracts/contracts/buyOrders/buyOrder.sol#L99)the NFT


### Impact

The buyOrder creator will lose the NFT

### Mitigation

After the buyOrder is completed,the NFT should be transferred  to the order creator

### Example 3

**Auto Label:** Inadequate authorization checks in NFT ownership and transfer logic enable unauthorized access, asset control, or fund theft through flawed validation of sender, receiver, or operator roles.  

**Original Text Preview:**

The `accountId` owners can not invoke the `SessionOrderModule.executeSessionOrdersBySig` function and the `SessionOrderModule.executeSessionOrders` function while they do not initiate themselves via the `SessionPermissionModule._initiateOrUpdateSession` function though the `accountId` owners are authorized to trade by default.

```solidity
    function _executeSessionOrders(
        address signer,
        uint128 accountId,
        MatchOrderDetails[] memory orders
    )
        internal
        returns (bytes[] memory)
    {
>>      if (!SessionPermissions.isPermissionActive(accountId, signer)) {
            revert Errors.Unauthorized(signer);
        }

        return executeMatchOrders(accountId, orders, Configuration.getCoreProxyAddress());
    }
<...>

library SessionPermissions {
<...>
    function isPermissionActive(uint128 accountId, address target) internal view returns (bool) {
        uint256 activeUntil = load(accountId).permissions[target];

        return activeUntil >= block.timestamp;
    }
```

Consider checking if the `msg.sender` is the `accountId` owner in the `_executeSessionOrders` function:

```diff
+import { isOwner } from "../libraries/AccountPermissions.sol";
<...>
    function _executeSessionOrders(
        address signer,
        uint128 accountId,
        MatchOrderDetails[] memory orders
    )
        internal
        returns (bytes[] memory)
    {
-       if (!SessionPermissions.isPermissionActive(accountId, signer)) {
+       if (!SessionPermissions.isPermissionActive(accountId, signer) &&
+           !isOwner(accountId, msg.sender, Configuration.getCoreProxyAddress())) {
            revert Errors.Unauthorized(signer);
        }

        return executeMatchOrders(accountId, orders, Configuration.getCoreProxyAddress());
    }
```
