# Cluster -1234

**Rank:** #422  
**Count:** 10  

## Label
Incorrect boolean checks and nested conditionals assume mutually exclusive states, so updates never run when legitimate liquidity or lifecycle flags differ, leaving pools unpaused and reserves stuck.

## Cluster Information

### Example 1

**Auto Label:** Flawed logical dependencies and incorrect conditionals lead to incorrect state updates or redundant operations, causing incorrect behavior or inefficiency under specific conditions.

## Non-zero Check in MiniPoolReserveLogic

**Severity:** Medium Risk  
**Context:** MiniPoolReserveLogic.sol#L320-L340  

**Description:**  
The second `if` block is nested in this context, although it is not nested in the lending pool's `ReserveLogic` library. (In Aave v2, it is nested):
```solidity
if (currentLiquidityRate != 0) {
    // ...
    if (scaledVariableDebt != 0) {
        // ...
    }
}
```
However, it is possible that `scaledVariableDebt` is non-zero even when `currentLiquidityRate` is 0 due to rounding errors or, for example, when both the Cod3x and reserve's owner's reserve factors sum up to 100%.

**Recommendation:**  
Make sure the `if` blocks are not nested and let the index updates happen separately:
```solidity
if (currentLiquidityRate != 0) {
    // ...
}
if (scaledVariableDebt != 0) {
    // ...
}
```

**Cod3x:** Fixed in commit 5ddd6f4b.  
**Spearbit:** Fix verified.

### Example 2

**Auto Label:** Misuse of conditional logic leading to unintended state transitions, flawed control flow, and ambiguous execution paths that enable unauthorized actions or undefined behavior.

## Context

## Description/Recommendation

1. **TransientNetflows.sol#L6**  
   Typo: "An helper" should be "A helper".

2. **TokenFlow.sol#L12-L13**  
   Visibility is missing for both constants; consider declaring them private:
   - ```solidity
     uint constant EXTERNAL_SCOPE = 0;
     uint constant INTERNAL_SCOPE = 1;
     ```
   + ```solidity
     uint256 constant private EXTERNAL_SCOPE = 0;
     uint256 constant private INTERNAL_SCOPE = 1;
     ```

3. **TokenFlow.sol#L35-L43**  
   The `main()` function performs a low-level call to `internalScope` when calling `enter()`.  
   However, since `abi.encodeCall()` is used and the logic in `main()` reverts on failure, a high-level call can be used instead:
   - ```solidity
     (bool ok, bytes memory err) = address(internalScope).call(abi.encodeCall(IFlowScope.enter,
     (SELECTOR_EXTENSION, constraints, msg.sender, data)));
     //...
     if (!ok) {
         clearTransientState();
         // bubble up the error
         assembly {
             revert(add(err, 0x20), mload(err))
         }
     }
     ```
   + ```solidity
     IFlowScope(internalScope).enter(SELECTOR_EXTENSION, constraints, msg.sender, data);
     ```
   The only difference is that when using a low-level call, `main()` does not revert if `internalScope` is an address without code. However, this is not desired behavior.

## Flood
All issues have been fixed in commit e434c000.

## Cantina Managed
Verified, all recommendations have been implemented.

### Example 3

**Auto Label:** Misuse of conditional logic leading to unintended state transitions, flawed control flow, and ambiguous execution paths that enable unauthorized actions or undefined behavior.  

**Original Text Preview:**

**Severity**

**Impact:** High

**Likelihood:** Medium

**Description**

Pools are designed to be paused, unpaused or killed. If killed, they cannot then be unpaused again.

Lets look at the `unpause` function.

```solidity
 if (!paused) revert Pool__NotPaused();
if (!killed) revert Pool__Killed();
paused = false;
```

The second line checks the killed status. It basically says that if the pool is not killed, the function should revert. This is a logical flaw. The function should revert IF the pool IS killed, not otherwise. The pool `killed` variable starts out as false. Thus if a pool is paused and then unpaused, the unpause will not happen since `!false=true`, so the revert will trigger.

A similar issue is present in the `kill` function.

```solidity
if (!killed) revert Pool__Killed();
        killed = true;
```

Again, if the contract is already killed this should revert. In the current state, the contract can never be killed, since `killed` is set to false by default, so `!killed` will always be true, making this code unreachable.

**Recommendations**

In both cases, change the clause to `if(killed)`
