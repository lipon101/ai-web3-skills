# Cluster -1019

**Rank:** #273  
**Count:** 30  

## Label
Failing to track expired sessions and enforce session validation lets attackers treat stale keys as active, enabling them to bypass checks, hijack ownership flows, and execute unauthorized, replayed transactions that drain funds.

## Examples

### Example 1

**Auto Label:** Inconsistent session validation and access control across operations lead to unauthorized actions, session hijacking, and silent failures, enabling replay attacks and privilege escalation.  

**Original Text Preview:**

Within `SessionLib.validate`, it checks `transaction.to` to ensure it is not set to `msg.sender`, preventing callers from abusing session keys to administer the smart account. However, it allows `transaction.to` to be set to `SessionKeyValidator`, which could enable callers to create additional session keys with unrestricted calls if allowed.

```solidity
  function validate(
    SessionStorage storage state,
    Transaction calldata transaction,
    SessionSpec memory spec,
    uint64[] memory periodIds
  ) internal {
    // Here we additionally pass uint64[] periodId to check allowance limits
    // periodId is defined as block.timestamp / limit.period if limitType == Allowance, and 0 otherwise (which will be ignored).
    // periodIds[0] is for fee limit,
    // periodIds[1] is for value limit,
    // periodIds[2:] are for call constraints, if there are any.
    // It is required to pass them in (instead of computing via block.timestamp) since during validation
    // we can only assert the range of the timestamp, but not access its value.

    require(state.status[msg.sender] == Status.Active, "Session is not active");
    TimestampAsserterLocator.locate().assertTimestampInRange(0, spec.expiresAt);

    address target = address(uint160(transaction.to));

    if (transaction.paymasterInput.length >= 4) {
      bytes4 paymasterInputSelector = bytes4(transaction.paymasterInput[0:4]);
      require(
        paymasterInputSelector != IPaymasterFlow.approvalBased.selector,
        "Approval based paymaster flow not allowed"
      );
    }

    if (transaction.data.length >= 4) {
      // Disallow self-targeting transactions with session keys as these have the ability to administer
      // the smart account.
>>>   require(address(uint160(transaction.to)) != msg.sender, "Can not target self");

   // ...
  }
```

Consider reverting if `transaction.to` is set to the `SessionKeyValidator` address.

### Example 2

**Auto Label:** Improper session validation and state management lead to unauthorized access, session hijacking, and resource exhaustion through flawed access checks, incorrect timestamp logic, and unbounded iteration.  

**Original Text Preview:**

When `sessionStatus` and `sessionState` are called by the user to get the provided session key status, it will return `Active`, even if the session has already expired. This returned value could mislead users, implying that the session key can still be used. Consider adding an additional state (e.g., `Expired`), or returning `Closed` if the session has already expired.

## Description

When the module is removed, `disable` will be called after the module has been removed from the registered list.

```solidity
    function _removeModule(address module) internal {
        _modulesLinkedList().remove(module);

>>>     (bool success, ) = module.excessivelySafeCall(
            gasleft(),
            0,
            0,
            abi.encodeWithSelector(IInitable.disable.selector)
        );
        (success); // silence unused local variable warning

        emit RemoveModule(module);
    }
```

Inside `SessionKeyValidator`, it attempts to trigger `removeModuleValidator` and `removeHook`, which are restricted functions that can only be called via self-call or by registered modules.

```solidity
  function disable() external {
    if (_isInitialized(msg.sender)) {
      // Here we have to revoke all keys, so that if the module
      // is installed again later, there will be no active sessions from the past.
      // Problem: if there are too many keys, this will run out of gas.
      // Solution: before uninstalling, require that all keys are revoked manually.
      require(sessionCounter[msg.sender] == 0, "Revoke all keys first");
>>>   IValidatorManager(msg.sender).removeModuleValidator(address(this));
>>>   IHookManager(msg.sender).removeHook(address(this), true);
    }
  }
```

```solidity
   function removeModuleValidator(address validator) external onlySelfOrModule {
        _removeModuleValidator(validator);
    }
```

```solidity
    function removeHook(address hook, bool isValidation) external override onlySelfOrModule {
        _removeHook(hook, isValidation);
    }
```

But since `SessionKeyValidator` is no longer registered as a module, the calls will silently fail, as `removeModule` doesn't enforce the `disable` call to succeed. This will wrongly give the impression to users that `SessionKeyValidator` is no longer registered as a hook and module validator.

## Recommendations

Consider moving `disable` call before removing the module from the list.
