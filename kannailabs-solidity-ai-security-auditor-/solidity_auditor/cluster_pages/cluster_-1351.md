# Cluster -1351

**Rank:** #394  
**Count:** 13  

## Label

### Summary

After sellNFT is completed, the NFT should be transferred  to the order creator, but this is not done.

### Root Cause

After the buyOrder is completed, the order creator does not receive the NFT, and the NFT is sent directly to **[buyOrderContract](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-debita-finance-v3/blob/1465ba6884c4cc44f7fc28e51f792db346ab1e33/Debita-V3-Contracts/contracts/buyOrders/buyOrder.sol#L99)**

The latter only emits an event and deletes the order, but does not transfer the NFT to  the order creator

### Internal pre-conditions



### External pre-conditions

1. User A  create buyOrder.
2. User B  **sellNFT**.

### Attack Path
1. User A  create buyOrder.
2. User B  **sellNFT**,and [receive](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-debita-finance-v3/blob/1465ba6884c4cc44f7fc28e51f792db346ab1e33/Debita-V3-Contracts/contracts/buyOrders/buyOrder.sol#L122) **buyToken**
3.  But **order creator** will[ lose ](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-debita-finance-v3/blob/1465ba6884c4cc44f7fc28e51f792db346ab1e33/Debita-V3-Contracts/contracts/buyOrders/buyOrder.sol#L99)the NFT


### Impact

The buyOrder creator will lose the NFT

### Mitigation

After the buyOrder is completed,the NFT should be transferred  to the order creator

### Example 2

**Auto Label:** Missing or flawed ownership validation and access control leads to unchecked, irreversible authority, enabling centralized control and permanent system failure.

## Summary

`__Ownable_init()` is not called in `LenderCommitmentGroup_Smart::initialize()`, which will make the contract not have any owner.

## Vulnerability Detail

`LenderCommitmentGroup_Smart::initialize()` does not call `__Ownable_init()` and will be left without owner.  

## Impact

Inability to [pause](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-04-teller-finance/blob/main/teller-protocol-v2-audit-2024/packages/contracts/contracts/LenderCommitmentForwarder/extensions/LenderCommitmentGroup/LenderCommitmentGroup_Smart.sol#L793) and [unpause](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-04-teller-finance/blob/main/teller-protocol-v2-audit-2024/packages/contracts/contracts/LenderCommitmentForwarder/extensions/LenderCommitmentGroup/LenderCommitmentGroup_Smart.sol#L800) borrowing in `LenderCommitmentGroup_Smart` due to having no owner, as these functions are `onlyOwner`.

## Tool used

Manual Review

Vscode

## Recommendation

Modify `LenderCommitmentGroup_Smart::initialize()` to call  `__Ownable_init()`:
```solidity
function initialize(
    ...
) external initializer returns (address poolSharesToken_) {
    __Ownable_init();
}
```

### Example 3

**Auto Label:** Insufficient ownership and authorization checks enable unauthorized asset manipulation, leading to loss of control, unauthorized transfers, and potential theft through improper validation of caller identity or transaction order.  

**Original Text Preview:**

**Severity**: Critical

**Status**:  Resolved

**Description**

Since the CryptoPunks NFT collection not implementing the ERC721 standard, depositing of CryptoPunks NFTs is handled via a separate flow:
Token owner needs to call `offerPunkForSaleToAddress` and set the `toAddress` value to the address of the pool the token will be deposited into.
Token owner then calls the mint function of the PNFTToken contract.
The PNFTToken contract buys CryptoPunk from its owner. 

However, the mint function can be called by anyone, so the attacker can frontrun the legitimate mint call. The contract will buy the NFT and it will be on the caller's account even if the caller is not the owner of the token.
```js
 it("CryptoPunk can be stolen via mint frontrunning", async () => {
   // user 1 want to supply CryptoPunk NFT
   await app.cryptopunks
     .connect(app.user1)
     .offerPunkForSaleToAddress(tokenId, 0, app.pcryptopunks.address);


   //user 2 frontrun the mint call
   await app.pcryptopunks.connect(app.user2).mint(tokenId);
   await app.unitroller
     .connect(app.user2)
     .enterNFTMarkets([app.pcryptopunks.address]);


   expect(await app.pcryptopunks.ownerOf(tokenId)).to.equal(app.user2.address);
 });
```

**Recommendation**: 

It is advisable to verify that `msg.sender` is the rightful owner of the token, before buying a CryptoPunk.
