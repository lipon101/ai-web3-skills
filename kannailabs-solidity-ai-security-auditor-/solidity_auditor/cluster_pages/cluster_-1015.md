## Examples

### Example 1

**Auto Label:** Insufficient input validation allows malicious actors to assign invalid addresses or exceed bounds, leading to unintended state changes, fund loss, or exploitable transaction flows.  

**Original Text Preview:**

When operations with address parameters are performed, it is crucial to ensure the address is not set to zero. Setting an address to zero is problematic because it has special burn/renounce semantics. This action should be handled by a separate function to prevent accidental loss of access during value or ownership transfers.

Throughout the codebase, there are multiple instances where operations are missing a zero address check:

* The [`_setMessenger(messengerType, dstDomainId, srcChainToken, srcChainMessenger)`](https://github.com/across-protocol/contracts/blob/c5d7541037d19053ce2106583b1b711037483038/contracts/AdapterStore.sol#L34) operation within the contract `AdapterStore` in `AdapterStore.sol`.
* The [`_setMessenger(messengerTypes[i], dstDomainIds[i], srcChainTokens[i], srcChainMessengers[i])`](https://github.com/across-protocol/contracts/blob/c5d7541037d19053ce2106583b1b711037483038/contracts/AdapterStore.sol#L52) operation within the contract `AdapterStore` in `AdapterStore.sol`.
* The [`_adapterStore`](https://github.com/across-protocol/contracts/blob/c5d7541037d19053ce2106583b1b711037483038/contracts/libraries/OFTTransportAdapterWithStore.sol#L17) operation within the contract `OFTTransportAdapterWithStore` in `OFTTransportAdapterWithStore.sol`.
* The [`_setOftMessenger(token, messenger)`](https://github.com/across-protocol/contracts/blob/c5d7541037d19053ce2106583b1b711037483038/contracts/SpokePool.sol#L363) operation within the contract `SpokePool` in `SpokePool.sol`.

Consider adding a zero address check before assigning a state variable.

***Update:** Acknowledged, not resolved. The team stated:*

> *After internal discussion, we think that zero-address checks here are a bit of overkill because all the functions mentioned are only callable by admin (except for `_adapterStore` case, but that's contract creation, and this contract can only be used within the system after admin action)*

### Example 2

**Auto Label:** Unsafe arithmetic operations without overflow/underflow checks lead to incorrect state updates, enabling data corruption, unauthorized access, or exploitable behavior through arithmetic wrapping.  

**Original Text Preview:**

In the [`_swapAndBridge` function](https://github.com/across-protocol/contracts/blob/b84dbfae35030e0f2caa5509b632c10106a32330/contracts/SpokePoolPeriphery.sol#L575), the adjusted output amount is [calculated](https://github.com/across-protocol/contracts/blob/b84dbfae35030e0f2caa5509b632c10106a32330/contracts/SpokePoolPeriphery.sol#L604-L606) as the product of `depositData.outputAmount` and `returnAmount` divided by `minExpectedInputTokenAmount`. If `depositData.outputAmount * returnAmount` exceeds `2^256–1`, the transaction will revert immediately on the multiply step, even when the eventual division result would fit. This intermediate overflow is invisible to users, who only see a generic failure without an explanatory error message.

Consider using OpenZeppelin’s [`Math.mulDiv(a, b, c)`](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/blob/48bd2864c6c696bf424ee0e2195f2d72ddd1a86c/contracts/utils/math/Math.sol#L204) to compute `floor(a*b/c)` without intermediate overflow. Alternatively, consider documenting the possible overflow scenario.

***Update:** Resolved in [pull request #1020](https://github.com/across-protocol/contracts/pull/1020) at commit [`e872f04`](https://github.com/across-protocol/contracts/pull/1020/commits/e872f045bd2bbdb42d8ca74c2133d0afa63ae07b) by documenting the potential overflow scenario.*

### Example 3

**Auto Label:** Insufficient input validation leads to unauthorized operations, incorrect routing, or unintended token transfers, enabling denial-of-service, fund loss, or malicious redirection.  

**Original Text Preview:**

The [`SwapProxy` contract](https://github.com/across-protocol/contracts/blob/b84dbfae35030e0f2caa5509b632c10106a32330/contracts/SpokePoolPeriphery.sol#L26) contains the [`performSwap` function](https://github.com/across-protocol/contracts/blob/b84dbfae35030e0f2caa5509b632c10106a32330/contracts/SpokePoolPeriphery.sol#L67), which allows the caller to execute a swap in two ways: [by approving or sending tokens to the specified exchange](https://github.com/across-protocol/contracts/blob/b84dbfae35030e0f2caa5509b632c10106a32330/contracts/SpokePoolPeriphery.sol#L81-L84), or by [approving tokens through the `Permit2` contract](https://github.com/across-protocol/contracts/blob/b84dbfae35030e0f2caa5509b632c10106a32330/contracts/SpokePoolPeriphery.sol#L86-L101). However, since it is possible to supply any address as the `exchange` parameter and any call data through the `routerCalldata` parameter of the `performSwap` function, the `SwapProxy` contract may be forced to perform an [arbitrary call to an arbitrary address](https://github.com/across-protocol/contracts/blob/b84dbfae35030e0f2caa5509b632c10106a32330/contracts/SpokePoolPeriphery.sol#L108).

This could be exploited by an attacker, who could force the `SwapProxy` contract to call the [`invalidateNonces` function](https://github.com/Uniswap/permit2/blob/cc56ad0f3439c502c246fc5cfcc3db92bb8b7219/src/AllowanceTransfer.sol#L113) of the `Permit2` contract, specifying an arbitrary spender and a nonce higher than the current one. As a result, the nonce for the given (token, spender) pair will be [updated](https://github.com/Uniswap/permit2/blob/cc56ad0f3439c502c246fc5cfcc3db92bb8b7219/src/AllowanceTransfer.sol#L124). If the `performSwap` function is called again later, it [will attempt to use a subsequent nonce](https://github.com/across-protocol/contracts/blob/b84dbfae35030e0f2caa5509b632c10106a32330/contracts/SpokePoolPeriphery.sol#L95), which has been invalidated by the attacker and the code inside `Permit2` will [revert due to nonces mismatch](https://github.com/Uniswap/permit2/blob/cc56ad0f3439c502c246fc5cfcc3db92bb8b7219/src/AllowanceTransfer.sol#L138).

As the `performSwap` function is the only place where the nonce passed to the `Permit2` contract is updated, the possibility of swapping a given token on a certain exchange will be blocked forever, which impacts all the functions of the [`SpokePoolPeriphery` contract](https://github.com/across-protocol/contracts/blob/b84dbfae35030e0f2caa5509b632c10106a32330/contracts/SpokePoolPeriphery.sol#L140) related to swapping tokens. The attack may be performed for many different (tokens, exchange) pairs.

Consider not allowing the `exchange` parameter to be equal to the `Permit2` contract address.

***Update:** Resolved in [pull request #1016](https://github.com/across-protocol/contracts/pull/1016) at commit [`713e76b`](https://github.com/across-protocol/contracts/pull/1016/commits/713e76b8388d90b4c3fbbe3d16b531d3ef81c722).*
