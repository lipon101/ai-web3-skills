# Cluster -1045

**Rank:** #298  
**Count:** 24  

## Label
Missing time-weighted balance accounting and enforced holding periods lets flashloan or timed staking actors skew snapshots and drain rewards, allowing them to capture outsized incentives while other participants lose fairness.

## Cluster Information
- **Total Findings:** 24

## Examples

### Example 1

**Auto Label:** Attackers exploit timing gaps and state transitions in trove lifecycle operations to manipulate reward distribution, avoid fees, or shift debt burdens—enabling reward theft, unfair allocation, or profit from bad debt without collateral.  

**Original Text Preview:**

## Severity

**Impact:** High

**Likelihood:** Low

## Description

When a liquidation occurs and the stability pool does not have enough funds to absorb the bad debt, this debt is distributed among all active troves.

Before a big liquidation that will cause a redistribution of bad debt, trove owners can withdraw their collateral just before the liquidation happens and open the trove again just after the liquidation, thus avoiding the redistribution of bad debt and increasing the bad debt of other troves.

## Recommendations

Implement a two-step mechanism for closing troves such that the request and the execution of the closing are separated by a time delay.

---
### Example 2

**Auto Label:** Reward manipulation through timing, weight control, or imbalance exploitation enables attackers to unfairly inflate reward eligibility or extract disproportionate benefits via unauthorized or short-term actions.

## Summary

The RAAC Gauge system implements a reward distribution mechanism where users can stake tokens and earn rewards based on their stake amount and `veToken` balance (includes a boost multiplier feature that affects reward calculations). Users staking and withdrawing repeatedly a large amount of tokens can game the system and maximize the rewards.

## Vulnerability Details

The current implementation allows users to manipulate their reward earnings by:

* temporarily staking large amounts of tokens
* claiming or accruing rewards based on the inflated stake
* quickly withdrawing the staked tokens
* repeating this process to maximize rewards

The system lacks of implementation of time-weighted average balances and of a minimum staking period or withdrawal penalties. So it is subsceptible to short-term staking manipulation. Users staking and withdrawing repeatedly a large amount of tokens can game the system and maximize the rewards.

```Solidity
function stake(uint256 amount) external nonReentrant updateReward(msg.sender) {
        if (amount == 0) revert InvalidAmount();
        _totalSupply += amount;
@>      _balances[msg.sender] += amount;
        stakingToken.safeTransferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), amount);
        emit Staked(msg.sender, amount);
    }

    function withdraw(uint256 amount) external nonReentrant updateReward(msg.sender) {
        if (amount == 0) revert InvalidAmount();
        if (_balances[msg.sender] < amount) revert InsufficientBalance();
        _totalSupply -= amount;
@>      _balances[msg.sender] -= amount;
        stakingToken.safeTransfer(msg.sender, amount);
        emit Withdrawn(msg.sender, amount);
    }
```

### Example 3

**Auto Label:** Reward manipulation through timing, weight control, or imbalance exploitation enables attackers to unfairly inflate reward eligibility or extract disproportionate benefits via unauthorized or short-term actions.  

**Original Text Preview:**

## Summary

When a user withdraws deposited RToken from StabilityPool, the pool transfers corresponding RAACToken rewards to the user. The reward amount is calculated currently deposited RToken *pro rata*. This means if an attacker withdraws 1 wei from StabilityPool multiple times, they can get nearly the same reward share for all the withdrawals. This way, the attacker gain major portion of RAACToken rewards, and ultimately will gain significant voting power and can disrupt the protocol.

## Vulnerability Details

**Root Cause Analysis**

Users can deposit RToken into StabilityPool to receive RAACToken rewards.

RAACToken is minted from RAACMinter on certain emission rate and transferred to StabilityPool.

Users can claim RAACTokens when they withdraw deposited RToken from StabilityPool.

The vulnerability lies in the fact that how RToken reward amount is calculated:

```Solidity
    function calculateRaacRewards(address user) public view returns (uint256) {
        uint256 userDeposit = userDeposits[user];
        uint256 totalDeposits = deToken.totalSupply();

        uint256 totalRewards = raacToken.balanceOf(address(this));
        if (totalDeposits < 1e6) return 0;

@>      return (totalRewards * userDeposit) / totalDeposits;
    }
```

In other words, the user receives `totalRewards * userDeposit / totalDeposits` when they withdraw from StabilityPool.

Consider the following scenario:

* StabilityPool currently has 1000 RAACToken, i.e. `totalRewards = 1000`
* User has 100 RToken deposits, i.e. `userDeposit = 100`
* `DEToken`has 1000 total supply i.e. `totalDeposits = 1000`
* User withdraws `1 wei` from StabilityPool

  * User's raac rewards would be `100 - (1e-18) / 1000 * 1000 = 100 - (1e-18)`
  * User receives nearly 100 RAACToken
  * StabilityPool now has 900 RAACToken
* User withdraws another `1 wei`from StabiltyPool

  * User's raac rewards would be `100 - (2e-18) / 900 * (1000 - 1e-18) = 90 `     &#x20;
  * User receives nearly 90 RAACToken
  * StabiltyPool now has 810 RAACToken
* User can repeats dust withdrawal process as many times as they want, and they will always receive around 1/10 of total rewards.
* After repeating above process for enough times, user can siphon most of the rewards the StabilityPool holds

### POC

**Scenario**

* Alice has 10000 RToken and deposits 10000 RToken to StabilityPool
* Eve has 1000 RToken and deposits 1000 RToken to StabilityPool
* 7 days pass, and StabilityPool accrues some rewards
* Eve withdraws `1 wei` from StabilityPool for 100 times
* Alice withdraws 5000 RToken from StabiltyPool
* Eve has most of the RAAC rewards, Alice only receives dust amount of rewards

**How to run POC**

* Follow [hardhat foundry integration tutorial](https://hardhat.org/hardhat-runner/docs/advanced/hardhat-and-foundry#adding-foundry-to-a-hardhat-project)

## Impact

* Attackers can steal RAAC rewards from other users
* Attackers can gain significant voting power and can inflict damage to the protocol with voting system

## Tools Used

## Recommendations

* RAAC rewards should be calculated like the following:

```Solidity

totalRewards * withdrawnAmount / totalDeposits
```

* Already claimed rewards should be deducted from reward amount
