# Cluster -1275

**Rank:** #137  
**Count:** 104  

## Label
Embedding hardcoded numerical literals instead of the intended named constants removes contextual meaning, increasing risk of miscalculation or security bugs across logic paths and making the code harder to audit or maintain.

## Cluster Information
- **Total Findings:** 104

## Examples

### Example 1

**Auto Label:** Hardcoded values and inconsistent constant usage lead to reduced readability, increased error risk, and compromised maintainability through ambiguous or mutable logic.  

**Original Text Preview:**

##### Description
Although the `LimitOrderManager` contract defines `bytes internal constant ZERO_BYTES = bytes('');`, three calls to `IAlgebraPool.burn()` still pass the literal empty string `''` instead of the constant, reducing consistency and readability.
<br/>
##### Recommendation
We recommend replacing the string literals with `ZERO_BYTES` in all relevant calls.

### Example 2

**Auto Label:** Hardcoded numerical values lack context, increase error risk, and undermine readability and auditability in critical logic paths, leading to maintainability and security vulnerabilities.  

**Original Text Preview:**

##### Description
The `DIAWhitelistedStaking` contract uses the hardcoded value `24 * 60 * 60` to calculate `passedDays` in its reward logic. However, the constant `SECONDS_PER_DAY` is already defined in the `StakingErrorsAndEvents` file for this exact purpose. Using the hardcoded expression instead of the named constant introduces inconsistency in the codebase and reduces readability.
<br/>
##### Recommendation
We recommend replacing the hardcoded `24 * 60 * 60` expression in the `passedDays` calculation with the `SECONDS_PER_DAY` constant defined in `StakingErrorsAndEvents`. This promotes code consistency and improves maintainability across the staking contracts.

> **Client's Commentary:**
> hardcoded values are moved to use constant

### Example 3

**Auto Label:** Hardcoded numerical values lack context, increase error risk, and undermine readability and auditability in critical logic paths, leading to maintainability and security vulnerabilities.  

**Original Text Preview:**

**Description:** `LibDoubleGeometricDistribution` and `LibCarpetedDoubleGeometricDistribution` both define the following constant:

```solidity
uint256 internal constant MIN_LIQUIDITY_DENSITY = Q96 / 1e3;
```

However, both instances are unused and can be removed as they appear to have been erroneously copied from the `LibGeometricDistribution` and `LibCarpetedGeometricDistribution` libraries.

**Bacon Labs:** Fixed in [PR \#112](https://github.com/timeless-fi/bunni-v2/pull/112).

**Cyfrin:** Verified, the unused constants have been removed from `LibCarpetedDoubleGeometricDistribution`.
