# Cluster -1277

**Rank:** #156  
**Count:** 88  

## Label
Not marking state variables that never change as immutable causes unnecessary storage reads and gas burn, making constructor initialization less efficient and leaving deployment logic susceptible to accidental modifications that degrade performance.

## Examples

### Example 1

**Auto Label:** Lack of immutability in state variables leads to unnecessary gas costs, compromised contract integrity, and potential runtime manipulation, undermining security and efficiency.

##### Description

The issue is identified within the [HanjiLOB](https://github.com/longgammalabs/hanji-contracts/blob/70b15ec4d9e7578248141604503843716a67d875/src/HanjiLOB.sol#L55) contract.

Variables with the `immutable` modifier do not use storage, which makes them more gas-efficient. In the context of a proxy pattern, it is still acceptable to initialize such variables in the constructor instead of the `initialize` function. Doing so can result in significant gas savings when these variables are accessed.

In this case, the following variables can be marked as `immutable` and initialized in the constructor to optimize gas usage:

- `token_x`
- `token_y`
- `scaling_factor_token_x`
- `scaling_factor_token_y`
- `supports_native_eth`
- `is_token_x_weth`
- `askTrie`
- `bidTrie`

The issue is classified as **low** severity because, while it does not pose a security risk, optimizing these variables can lead to more efficient contract execution and reduced gas costs.
##### Recommendation
We recommend marking these variables as `immutable` and initializing them in the constructor to achieve better gas efficiency.

### Example 2

**Auto Label:** Lack of immutability in state variables leads to unnecessary gas costs, compromised contract integrity, and potential runtime manipulation, undermining security and efficiency.  

**Original Text Preview:**

##### Description
The [`commission_scaling_factor`](https://github.com/longgammalabs/hanji-contracts/blob/09b6188e028650b9c1758010846080c5f8c80f8e/src/OnchainLOB.sol#L51) is set as an `immutable` variable, but it is typically a constant value (e.g., `1e6`) in many contracts. Using a constant instead of an immutable variable can optimize gas usage and improve clarity.
##### Recommendation
We recommend setting the `commission_scaling_factor` as a constant with a value of `1e6`.

### Example 3

**Auto Label:** Lack of immutability in state variables leads to unnecessary gas costs, compromised contract integrity, and potential runtime manipulation, undermining security and efficiency.  

**Original Text Preview:**

##### Description
The `pyth` address is stored as a regular state variable. If this address is never intended to change, making it effectively immutable could save gas on repeated reads.

The issue is classified as **low** severity because it focuses on optimization rather than a security flaw.

##### Recommendation
We recommend defining `pyth` as an `immutable` variable within the constructor if updates are unnecessary post-deployment.
