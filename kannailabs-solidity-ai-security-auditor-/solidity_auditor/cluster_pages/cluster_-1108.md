# Cluster -1108

**Rank:** #78  
**Count:** 213  

## Label
Duplicate conditional guards stem from re-implementing validation logic instead of sharing a single invariant enforcement point, causing extra gas burn and opening the door to inconsistent state or corruption.

## Cluster Information
- **Total Findings:** 213

## Examples

### Example 1

**Auto Label:** Redundant validation and control flow checks that fail to enforce critical invariants, leading to unnecessary gas costs, potential state corruption, or inconsistent execution—often due to poor logic design or lack of abstraction.  

**Original Text Preview:**

**Description:** `else` can be omitted in `mintWithTerms` since if signature validation failed a revert will occur:
```diff
        if (!_verifySignature(signature)) revert SoulBoundToken__InvalidSignature();
-       else emit SignatureVerified(msg.sender, signature);
+       emit SignatureVerified(msg.sender, signature);
        tokenId = _mintSoulBoundToken(msg.sender);
```

**Evo:**
Fixed in commit [e3b2f74](https://github.com/contractlevel/sbt/commit/e3b2f74239601b2721118e11aaa92b42dbb502e9).

**Cyfrin:** Verified.

### Example 2

**Auto Label:** Redundant validation and control flow checks that fail to enforce critical invariants, leading to unnecessary gas costs, potential state corruption, or inconsistent execution—often due to poor logic design or lack of abstraction.  

**Original Text Preview:**

##### Description
In the `P2pYieldProxy.initialize`, the [conditions](https://github.com/p2p-org/p2p-lending-proxy/blob/677cac6d572df8600d0538df40b1e34cc41025f9/src/p2pYieldProxy/P2pYieldProxy.sol#L146-L153) `_clientBasisPointsOfDeposit >= 0` and `_clientBasisPointsOfProfit >= 0` are redundant because `uint48` is an unsigned integer type and cannot be negative.
<br/>
##### Recommendation
We recommend removing these redundant conditions and retaining only the upper-bound checks to simplify the code and improve readability.

> **Client's Commentary:**

### Example 3

**Auto Label:** Redundant validation and control flow checks that fail to enforce critical invariants, leading to unnecessary gas costs, potential state corruption, or inconsistent execution—often due to poor logic design or lack of abstraction.  

**Original Text Preview:**

##### Description
The `DIAOracleV2metadata` is currently present in two different repositories: Spectra-interoperability and decentral-feeder. This redundancy can lead to potential inconsistencies and maintenance challenges.

##### Recommendation
We recommend implementing a minimal contract interface for `DIAOracleV2metadata` in the Spectra interoperability module, instead of duplicating the full source code.
