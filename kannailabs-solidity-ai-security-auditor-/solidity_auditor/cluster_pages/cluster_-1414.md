# Cluster -1414

**Rank:** #307  
**Count:** 24  

## Label
Delayed or missing updates to total supply when external calls or bridged token accounting occur allow unchecked misreporting and can break downstream invariants or trigger unsafe CEI violations during receiver callbacks.

## Cluster Information
- **Total Findings:** 24

## Examples

### Example 1

**Auto Label:** Inconsistent or incorrect total supply tracking due to unit errors, flawed state updates, or misuse of supply variables, leading to inaccurate supply reporting, division-by-zero, or invalid state transitions.  

**Original Text Preview:**

The circulating amount of tokens on the current chain includes the bridged tokens.

```solidity
    function circulatingSupply() public view virtual override returns (uint) {
        return innerToken.totalSupply();
    }
```

Consider tracking a separate variable for bridged tokens to subtract it from `innerToken.totalSupply()`.

### Example 2

**Auto Label:** Inconsistent or incorrect total supply tracking due to unit errors, flawed state updates, or misuse of supply variables, leading to inaccurate supply reporting, division-by-zero, or invalid state transitions.  

**Original Text Preview:**

**Description:** When `MembershipERC1155::mint` is invoked during a call to `MembershipFactory::joinDAO`, the `totalSupply` increment is performed after the call to `ERC1155::_mint`:

```solidity
function mint(address to, uint256 tokenId, uint256 amount) external override onlyRole(OWP_FACTORY_ROLE) {
    _mint(to, tokenId, amount, "");
    totalSupply += amount * 2 ** (6 - tokenId); // Update total supply with weight
}
```

While there does not appear to be any immediate impact, this is in violation of the Checks-Effects-Interactions (CEI) pattern and thus potentially unsafe due to the [invocation](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/blob/49c0e4370d0cc50ea6090709e3835a3091e33ee2/contracts/token/ERC1155/ERC1155.sol#L285) of [`ERC1155::_doSafeTransferAcceptanceCheck`](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/blob/49c0e4370d0cc50ea6090709e3835a3091e33ee2/contracts/token/ERC1155/ERC1155.sol#L467-L486):

```solidity
if (to.isContract()) {
    try IERC1155Receiver(to).onERC1155Received(operator, from, id, amount, data) returns (bytes4 response) {
        if (response != IERC1155Receiver.onERC1155Received.selector) {
            revert("ERC1155: ERC1155Receiver rejected tokens");
        }
```

**Impact:** There does not appear to be any immediate impact, although any code executed within a receiver smart contract will work with an incorrect `totalSupply` state.

**Recommended Mitigation:** Consider increasing the `totalSupply` before the call to `_mint()`.

**One World Project:** Updated the pattern in [`30465a3`](https://github.com/OneWpOrg/smart-contracts-blockchain-1wp/commit/30465a3197adea883413298a9ac17fe8a1f0289e).

**Cyfrin:** Verified. State changes now done before external call is made.

### Example 3

**Auto Label:** Inconsistent supply tracking due to manual state management and lack of synchronization, leading to logic errors, token collisions, and invalid state transitions.  

**Original Text Preview:**

## Vulnerability Overview

The vulnerability concerns the integrity of the snapshot process. A successful snapshot relies on accurately capturing the total supply of tokens and distinguishing between those that are counted (unlocked) and those that are not (locked). 

The `join` function allows two different tokens to be merged into one, potentially altering the balances and total supply of tokens mid-snapshot. If tokens that are part of the snapshot join with those that are not, `total_supply` will no longer be equal to `unlocked_sum + locked_sum`.

## Remediation

Employ a locking mechanism to block `shared_token::join` during the snapshot process.

## Patch

Resolved in commit `f6fa43b`.
