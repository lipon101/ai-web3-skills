# Cluster -1220

**Rank:** #42  
**Count:** 484  

## Label
Skipping checks of vault or auction state before acting lets outdated or conflicting data persist, causing incorrect mappings, blocked bids, unauthorized access, and asset loss during invalid transitions.

## Cluster Information
- **Total Findings:** 484

## Examples

### Example 1

**Auto Label:** Insufficient state validation leads to persistent or incorrect access control, enabling unauthorized interactions, asset draining, or invalid operations.  

**Original Text Preview:**

In `ZipperFactoryVault:createVault`, two mapping values, `tokenToVault` and `vaultToToken`, are assigned. The issue arises when a changer updates these values later using a new vault address. However, the data for the `oldVault` is not deleted, leading to potential issues with outdated mappings.

### Example 2

**Auto Label:** Insufficient state validation leads to persistent or incorrect access control, enabling unauthorized interactions, asset draining, or invalid operations.  

**Original Text Preview:**

Each vault must be unique to a token. However, the `createVault` and `changeVault` functions do not check whether the vault key is already assigned to another token. This could result in a vault being overwritten or mistakenly reassigned, violating the uniqueness constraint.

Mitigation:
Add the following check to both functions to ensure the vault is not already in use by another token:

```solidity
require(vaultToToken[chainId][vault].length == 0, "Vault already exists for another token");
```

### Example 3

**Auto Label:** Insufficient state validation and unauthorized state manipulation enable attackers to bypass critical checks, leading to unauthorized transfers, auction manipulation, or protocol devaluation.  

**Original Text Preview:**

The `Folio.bid()` function enforces that bids specify a strict `sellAmount` such that `minSellAmount == sellAmount == maxSellAmount`.

```solidity
function bid(
    //...
    uint256 sellAmount,
    //...
) external nonReentrant notDeprecated sync returns (uint256 boughtAmt) {
    Auction storage auction = auctions[auctionId];

    // checks auction is ongoing and that boughtAmt is below maxBuyAmount
    (, boughtAmt, ) = _getBid(
        --- SNIPPED ---
        sellAmount,             //> minSellAmount
        sellAmount,             //> maxSellAmount
        maxBuyAmount
    );

    --- SNIPPED ---
}
```

The available sell balance is checked at execution time in `RebalanceLib::getBid()`:

```solidity
require(sellAvailable >= params.minSellAmount, IFolio.Folio__InsufficientSellAvailable());
```

This creates a scenario where any change to the protocol balance state between bid creation and execution can cause bids to revert, which can occur through:

1. Other bids: Each successful bid could reduce the `sellToken` balance.
2. Redemptions: These affect both the `sellToken` balance and the `sellLimitBal` calculation, as calculated below:
   ```solidity
    uint256 sellLimitBal = Math.mulDiv(sellLimit, params.totalSupply, D27, Math.Rounding.Ceil);
    uint256 sellAvailable = params.sellBal > sellLimitBal ? params.sellBal - sellLimitBal : 0;
   ```

This issue can be exploited through front-running or can occur naturally through normal protocol usage, blocking bids from executing.
As auction prices decay over time, the protocol could miss favorable execution opportunities.

**Consider the following scenario**:

#### Initial state

0. `totalSupply()` 1000 shares, rebalance targeting reduction from 1000 ETH to 500 ETH, and buy 1,500,000 USDT:

   - 1 BU now consist of 1 ETH 0 USDT.
   - 1 BU traget to consist of 0.5 ETH, 1500 USDT.

1. User A submits a transaction for a full bid: 500 ETH → 1,500,000 USDT at start price (most favorable price).
2. User B front-runs with a minimal bid: 0.0003333 ETH → 1 USDT.
3. The sell token balance decreases to 999.9996667 ETH.
4. The `sellAvailable` becomes 499.9996667 ETH (999.9996667 - 500 ETH).
5. When User A's transaction executes, the check `499.9996667 >= 500` fails.
6. User A's bid reverts, and the protocol loses the opportunity to execute a large bid at a favorable price.

**Recommendation**

Allow a range for `sellAmount` by accepting bids with different `minSellAmount` and `maxSellAmount` values via `Folio.bid()`, allow to fill as much as is available within the range at execution time.

Or, prevent griefing by either freezing `redeem()` during active auctions, or introducing a redemption fee during auctions to disincentivize such attacks.
