# Cluster -1326

**Rank:** #124  
**Count:** 126  

## Label
Delegatecalls to unverified addresses or callers bypass contract existence and identity checks, letting attackers run arbitrary code, corrupt state, and self-destruct proxies, exposing funds and owners to takeover.

## Examples

### Example 1

**Auto Label:** Failure to validate target contract existence or integrity during delegatecall or upgrade, enabling silent failures, unauthorized control, or malicious code execution.  

**Original Text Preview:**

The `CLGauge` contract is designed to be upgradeable but currently inherits from `ERC721Holder`. It should instead inherit from `ERC721HolderUpgradeable` to ensure compatibility with upgradeable patterns.

```solidity
contract CLGauge is
    ICLGauge,
    UUPSUpgradeable,
    Ownable2StepUpgradeable,
    ERC721Holder
{
```

Since `CLGauge` is intended to be an upgradeable contract, it is crucial to use the upgradeable version of the `ERC721Holder`, which is `ERC721HolderUpgradeable`.

### Example 3

**Auto Label:** Failure to validate contract existence or caller identity during delegatecall enables arbitrary code execution, state manipulation, and unintended self-destruction, leading to loss of control and asset exposure.

### Finding description and impact

Li.Fi’s Executor contract is granted `SWAP_CALLER_ROLE`. The function `handleReallocation` is used inside the protocol to notify about user’s reallocation and can only be called by address that has `SWAP_CALLER_ROLE`. The intention of the protocol is to use the executor’s functions so that executor swaps assets and then calls `handleReallocation` inside `NudgeCampaign` / `NudgePointsCampaign` contract.

However, the Executor contract that has as a `SWAP_CALLER_ROLE` can be used by anyone (its functions do not have access control restrictions which is expected), anyone can call function `swapAndExecute`. This means that **any user** can call the `swapAndExecute` function and instruct the `Executor` to call **arbitrary functions** on other contracts.

As a result, an attacker can use the `Executor` to call `renounceRole` on the `NudgeCampaignFactory` contract, causing the `Executor` to lose its `SWAP_CALLER_ROLE`. This leads to DOS of every next `handleReallocation` call from Executor. Admin has to `grantRole` again to Executor contract, but user can repeat the process of `renouncingRole` using Executor.

Executor function that can be called is [here](https://github.com/lifinance/contracts/blob/b8c966aad30407b3f579723847057729549fd353/src/Periphery/Executor.sol# L105-L126).

### Proof of Concept

In order to POC to work, we must copy and paste contracts related to Executor and ERC20Proxy (the contract used by Executor) from official Li Fi’s contract repository so that we can use Executor inside our tests.

I’ve put LiFi’s contracts inside campaign directory in new folders created by me; Errors, Helpers, Interfaces, Libraries and Periphery:

    vm.stopPrank();

```

### Recommended mitigation steps

Disallow `Executor` to renounce their role, or store executor as address and only verify that `msg.sender` is executor; which would make it impossible to renounce the role from the executor.
