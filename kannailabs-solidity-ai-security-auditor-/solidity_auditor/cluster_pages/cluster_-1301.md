# Cluster -1301

**Rank:** #309  
**Count:** 23  

## Label
**Inadequate validation of input types and additional information fields causes parsers to mis-handle malformed CBOR or ACL data, leading to logic errors, memory corruption, or unauthorized access when attackers craft unexpected inputs.**

### Example 1

**Auto Label:** Insufficient input validation leads to arbitrary data interpretation, enabling memory corruption, incorrect deserialization, and potential logic errors through unbounded or malformed data processing.

## CBOR Decode Library - elementAt Function Analysis

## Context
(No context files were provided by the reviewer)

## Description
The `elementAt` function in the CborDecode library is responsible for parsing and extracting CBOR elements from a given byte array. However, the implementation has several concerns:

- When a CBOR simple or float value (major type `0xe0`) is passed, the function will not correctly handle the additional information (`ai`), which can lead to a situation where the function will truncate and interpret the value falsely or read beyond bounds, leading to undefined behaviour.
- For additional information (`ai`) values in the range of 28 to 30, the function does not implement any specific handling or error checking. If such a value is encountered, the function will default to handling it as if it were a value with a small `ai` (less than 24) and `ai = 31`, potentially resulting in incorrect parsing or data corruption.

## Recommendation
```solidity
function elementAt(bytes memory cbor, uint256 ix, uint8 expectedType, bool required)
    internal
    pure
    returns (CborElement)
{
    uint8 _type = uint8(cbor[ix] & 0xe0);
    uint8 ai = uint8(cbor[ix] & 0x1f);
    if (_type == 0xe0) {
        require(!required || ai != 22, "null value for required element");
        // @audit floats & simple should not be allowed
        // primitive type, retain the additional information
        return LibCborElement.toCborElement(_type | ai, ix + 1, 0);
    }
    require(_type == expectedType, "unexpected type");
    if (ai == 24) {
        return LibCborElement.toCborElement(_type, ix + 2, uint8(cbor[ix + 1]));
    } else if (ai == 25) {
        return LibCborElement.toCborElement(_type, ix + 3, cbor.readUint16(ix + 1));
    } else if (ai == 26) {
        return LibCborElement.toCborElement(_type, ix + 5, cbor.readUint32(ix + 1));
    } else if (ai == 27) {
        return LibCborElement.toCborElement(_type, ix + 9, cbor.readUint64(ix + 1));
    }
    // @audit should revert for ai >= 28 and ai <= 30
    // this is for ai = 31 and ai <= 23
    return LibCborElement.toCborElement(_type, ix + 1, ai);
}
```

### Example 2

**Auto Label:** Insufficient input validation leads to unauthorized data manipulation, financial loss, or system compromise through malformed or malicious inputs exploiting parsing and cryptographic weaknesses.  

**Original Text Preview:**

## Validate Source

`validateSource` checks the entire function (before + sesCompatibleSource + after). However, if `sesCompatibleSource` is manipulated, it may be possible to inject malicious code, which may break out of the sandbox if it is crafted in a specific way (such as closing `with()` statements or escaping contexts).

## Remediation

Validate `sesCompatibleSource` separately to ensure it contains only valid code and does not include malicious injections before it gets combined with the rest of the function. Additionally, enable the `runChecks` flag by default, ensuring that these validation checks are always performed.

## Diﬃculty: High

## Type: Data Validation

## Description
The IP address used to create Redpanda ACLs is not validated, which allows bypassing the host restriction from ACLs (Figure 7.1). Because the IP address can be an arbitrary string, it is possible to send an all hosts wildcard (*) instead of a concrete IP address.

```python
def create_acls(self, username: str, ip_address: str):
    """Create ACLs in redpanda for user."""
    self.logger.info("Creating ACLs")
    admin_client = KafkaAdminClient(bootstrap_servers=self.config.event_bus_brokers)
    read_acl = ACL(
        principal=f"User:{username}",
        host=ip_address,
        operation=ACLOperation.READ,
        permission_type=ACLPermissionType.ALLOW,
        resource_pattern=ResourcePattern(ResourceType.TOPIC, DATA_FRAME_TOPICS),
    )
    write_acl = ACL(
        principal=f"User:{username}",
        host=ip_address,
        operation=ACLOperation.WRITE,
        permission_type=ACLPermissionType.ALLOW,
        resource_pattern=ResourcePattern(ResourceType.TOPIC, ORDER_PROPOSAL_TOPICS),
    )
```

**Figure 7.1:** Unvalidated IP address ends up straight in ACLs  
(elixir-protocol-api/app/api/services/auth.py#L125-L144)

## Exploit Scenario
A malicious strategy executor sends a * instead of a concrete IP address to verify an endpoint. They use the Redpanda credentials to execute a distributed denial-of-service attack.

## Recommendations
Short term, require the IP address sent by strategy executors to be a concrete value, or take the IP address from the connection instead of the user having to provide it.
