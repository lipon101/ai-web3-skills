### Finding description and impact

Lets take the scenario where the HYPE to KHYPE exchange is `1 KHYPE = 1.5 KHYPE`.

At this point, let’s assume that there are in total `50 KHYPE` tokens queued for withdrawals, that is `75 HYPE` queued for withdrawals while the remaining `20 KHYPE` are still held by their respective holders worth `30 HYPE` in all.

This means that the locked in amount in the queued Withdrawals for each user across all queued withdrawals is `75 HYPE`.

We know this because of the logic in the queueWithdrawal function in the StakingManager below:
```

    uint256 hypeAmount = stakingAccountant.kHYPEToHYPE(postFeeKHYPE);

    // Lock kHYPE tokens
    kHYPE.transferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), kHYPEAmount);

    // Create withdrawal request
    _withdrawalRequests[msg.sender][withdrawalId] = WithdrawalRequest({
        hypeAmount: hypeAmount,
        kHYPEAmount: postFeeKHYPE,
        kHYPEFee: kHYPEFee,
        timestamp: block.timestamp
    });
```

That gives us a total of `70 KHYPE` to `105 HYPE` across the board when calulating the exchange ratio (including rewards).

Now let’s assume for some reason there’s a slashing event and the amount of HYPE in total reduces from `105 KHYPE` to `75 KHYPE`.

Now it leaves us with an exchange ratio of `70 KHYPE` to `75 HYPE` i.e `1 KHYPE = 1.071 HYPE`.

Since the guys who withdrew earlier already have their withdrawal delay processing first locked in with the ratio that was used before the slash, they all successfully confirm their withdrawal first and take the whole `75 HYPE` available, leaving 0 HYPE left for all the remaining `20 KHYPE` holders.

You can see the `confirmWithdrawal` function uses the withdrawalRequest amount `hypeAmount` stored which uses the previous ratio.
```

    function confirmWithdrawal(uint256 withdrawalId) external nonReentrant whenNotPaused {
        // @note - the process confirmation basically makes sure the khype amount to be withdrawn is in the contracts
        // ... it burns it, transfers the fee and makes sure the withdrawal delay has been exceeded, deletes the withdrawal request, updates the totalclaimed and totalqueuedwithdrawals
        // ... it then returns the hype amount to be received by the user
        uint256 amount = _processConfirmation(msg.sender, withdrawalId);
        require(amount > 0, "No valid withdrawal request");

        // @note - makes sure that the contract has the specified amount required to satisfy the withdrawals
        // @note - this is where the issue lies I guess, maybe not here, but if there was a slashing occurence before this confirmation of withdrawal, there could be an issue???
        require(address(this).balance >= amount, "Insufficient contract balance");

        // @note - updates the totalClaimed hype across all SM
        stakingAccountant.recordClaim(amount);

        // Process withdrawal using call instead of transfer
        (bool success,) = payable(msg.sender).call{value: amount}("");
        require(success, "Transfer failed");
    }
```

This leads to loss of stake for the remaining KHYPE holders even though there was enough to go 1:1.

### Recommended Mitigation Steps

A possible mitigation would be when confirming withdrawals, not to use the hypeAmount stored in the withdrawal request but to recalculate with the new ratio.

**Kinetiq disputed and commented:**

> Exchange rate adjusts only during rewards or slashing. When users queue withdrawals, their assets exit the validator, earning no profits, so the exchange rate remains fixed as when queued, until confirmation. The rate fluctuates slightly upon claiming due to total supply changes, but this is acceptable and not an issue for us.

### Example 2

**Auto Label:** Misconfigured or flawed reward calculation logic leading to inflated, lost, or unbounded rewards, compromising financial accuracy and user incentive alignment.

<https://github.com/code-423n4/2025-05-blackhole/blob/main/contracts/factories/BribeFactoryV3.sol# L209-L219>

### Finding description

The `recoverERC20AndUpdateData` function in the `BribeFactoryV3` contract incorrectly calls `emergencyRecoverERC20` instead of `recoverERC20AndUpdateData` on the `IBribe` interface. This misnamed function call results in the failure to update the `tokenRewardsPerEpoch` mapping in the `Bribe` contract, which is critical for maintaining accurate reward accounting.

### Root Cause

In `BribeFactoryV3.sol`, the `recoverERC20AndUpdateData` function is defined as follows:
```

function recoverERC20AndUpdateData(address[] memory _bribe, address[] memory _tokens, uint[] memory _amounts) external onlyOwner {
    uint i = 0;
    require(_bribe.length == _tokens.length, 'MISMATCH_LEN');
    require(_tokens.length == _amounts.length, 'MISMATCH_LEN');

    for(i; i < _bribe.length; i++){
        if(_amounts[i] > 0) IBribe(_bribe[i]).emergencyRecoverERC20(_tokens[i], _amounts[i]);
    }
}
```

The function calls `IBribe(_bribe[i]).emergencyRecoverERC20` instead of `IBribe(_bribe[i]).recoverERC20AndUpdateData`. The correct function, `recoverERC20AndUpdateData` in the `Bribe` contract, updates the `tokenRewardsPerEpoch` mapping to reflect the recovered tokens:
```

function recoverERC20AndUpdateData(address tokenAddress, uint256 tokenAmount) external onlyAllowed {
    require(tokenAmount <= IERC20(tokenAddress).balanceOf(address(this)), "TOO_MUCH");

    uint256 _startTimestamp = IMinter(minter).active_period() + WEEK;
    uint256 _lastReward = tokenRewardsPerEpoch[tokenAddress][_startTimestamp];
    tokenRewardsPerEpoch[tokenAddress][_startTimestamp] = _lastReward - tokenAmount;
    IERC20(tokenAddress).safeTransfer(owner, tokenAmount);
    emit Recovered(tokenAddress, tokenAmount);
}
```

In contrast, `emergencyRecoverERC20` only transfers tokens without updating the mapping:
```

function emergencyRecoverERC20(address tokenAddress, uint256 tokenAmount) external onlyAllowed {
    require(tokenAmount <= IERC20(tokenAddress).balanceOf(address(this)), "TOO_MUCH");
    IERC20(tokenAddress).safeTransfer(owner, tokenAmount);
    emit Recovered(tokenAddress, tokenAmount);
}
```

### Impact

Incorrect reward accounting - failing to update `tokenRewardsPerEpoch` can lead to over-distribution of rewards. Users may claim rewards based on outdated values, potentially draining the `Bribe` contract’s token balance.

### Recommended mitigation steps

Update the function Call in `BribeFactoryV3`:

Modify the `recoverERC20AndUpdateData` function in `BribeFactoryV3.sol` to call the correct `recoverERC20AndUpdateData` function.

**Test Result**: The test fails with the following error, confirming the bug:
```

AssertionError: Expected "0" to be equal -100000000000000000000
+ expected - actual

 {
-  "_hex": "-0x056bc75e2d63100000"
+  "_hex": "0x00"
   "_isBigNumber": true
 }
```

**Explanation**:

The test expects `tokenRewardsPerEpoch` to decrease by `100 ether` after calling `recoverERC20AndUpdateData` on `BribeFactoryV3`. However, because `emergencyRecoverERC20` is called instead, `tokenRewardsPerEpoch` remains unchanged (`0`), causing the test to fail.

This demonstrates that the incorrect function call in `BribeFactoryV3` skips the critical update to `tokenRewardsPerEpoch`, leading to potential reward over-distribution.

### Example 3

**Auto Label:** Misconfigured or flawed reward calculation logic leading to inflated, lost, or unbounded rewards, compromising financial accuracy and user incentive alignment.  

**Original Text Preview:**

### Finding description

The `GaugeCL::notifyRewardAmount` function attempts to update the `rewardRate` state variable, which is meant to track the reward emission rate for the current distribution period. However, the function declares a return variable named `rewardRate` (as part of the function’s return signature), which **shadows** the contract-level storage variable. As a result, assignments within the function update only the local return variable, and the **contract’s storage `rewardRate` is never updated**.

This leads to the reward rate always remaining at its initial value (`0`), and any queries to `rewardForDuration()` or other on-chain users referencing `rewardRate` will receive inaccurate results.
```

// @audit-issue Storage rewardRate is shadowed and never updated
function notifyRewardAmount(address token, uint256 reward)
    external nonReentrant isNotEmergency onlyDistribution
    returns (IncentiveKey memory incentivekey, uint256 rewardRate, uint128 bonusRewardRate)
{
    ...
    if (block.timestamp >= _periodFinish) {
        rewardRate = reward / DURATION;
    } else {
        uint256 remaining = _periodFinish - block.timestamp;
        uint256 leftover = remaining * rewardRate;
        rewardRate = (reward + leftover) / DURATION;
    }
    ...
}
```

### Issue identified

* The function’s return signature declares a local variable `rewardRate`, which **shadows** the contract’s storage variable of the same name.
* All assignments to `rewardRate` within the function only affect this local variable, not the contract storage.
* The contract storage variable `rewardRate` remains **permanently zero**, and is never updated by any function in the contract.
* Consequently, the function `rewardForDuration()` always returns `0`, misleading dApps, explorers, and UIs that rely on this state variable for reward calculations.

### Risk and impact

**Likelihood**:

* This is a deterministic bug and will always occur if the function signature is not fixed.
* Any user or protocol that queries `rewardForDuration()` or the public `rewardRate` will receive incorrect values.

**Impact**:

* Protocol dashboards, explorers, or analytic scripts may display incorrect or misleading reward information.
* Third-party tools or automated scripts that rely on on-chain `rewardRate` data could behave incorrectly.
* Does **not** directly cause loss of funds or user assets, but can lead to confusion or improper reward tracking.

### Recommended mitigation steps

Rename the function return variable to avoid shadowing, or directly assign to the storage variable inside the function:
```

function notifyRewardAmount(address token, uint256 reward)
    external
    nonReentrant
    isNotEmergency
    onlyDistribution
-   returns (IncentiveKey memory incentivekey, uint256 rewardRate, uint128 bonusRewardRate)
+   returns (IncentiveKey memory, uint256, uint128)
{
    require(token == address(rewardToken), "not rew token");
    if (block.timestamp >= _periodFinish) {
        rewardRate = reward / DURATION;
    } else {
        uint256 remaining = _periodFinish - block.timestamp;
        uint256 leftover = remaining * rewardRate;
        rewardRate = (reward + leftover) / DURATION;
    }
    _periodFinish = block.timestamp + DURATION;
    (IERC20Minimal rewardTokenAdd, IERC20Minimal bonusRewardTokenAdd, IAlgebraPool pool, uint256 nonce) =
        algebraEternalFarming.incentiveKeys(poolAddress);
-   incentivekey = IncentiveKey(rewardTokenAdd, bonusRewardTokenAdd, pool, nonce);
+   IncentiveKey memory incentivekey = IncentiveKey(rewardTokenAdd, bonusRewardTokenAdd, pool, nonce);
    bytes32 incentiveId = IncentiveId.compute(incentivekey);

    (,, address virtualPoolAddress,,,) = algebraEternalFarming.incentives(incentiveId);
-   (,bonusRewardRate) = IAlgebraEternalVirtualPool(virtualPoolAddress).rewardRates();
+   (,uint128 bonusRewardRate) = IAlgebraEternalVirtualPool(virtualPoolAddress).rewardRates();

    rewardToken.safeTransferFrom(DISTRIBUTION, address(this), reward);
    IERC20(token).safeApprove(farmingParam.algebraEternalFarming, reward);
    algebraEternalFarming.addRewards(incentivekey, uint128(reward), 0);
    emit RewardAdded(reward);
+   return(incentivekey, rewardRate, bonusRewardRate);
}
```

### Proof of Concept
```

// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity ^0.8.27;

contract ShadowedStorageExample {
    uint256 public rewardRate;

    function incrementRewardRate(uint256 amount) public returns (uint256 rewardRate) {
        rewardRate += amount;
    }
}
```

No matter how you call `incrementRewardRate` with different values, the storage variable `rewardRate` will **never change**. This is because the function’s return variable `rewardRate` shadows the contract’s storage variable of the same name.

All updates inside the function only affect the local return variable, not the storage.
As a result, `rewardRate()` (the public getter) will always return `0`, regardless of how many times you call the function or what arguments you provide.
