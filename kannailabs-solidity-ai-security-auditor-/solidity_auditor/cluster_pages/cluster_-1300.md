## Description
The `update_code_cell` helper function writes a cell with the wrong structure to storage. If the `opcodes::update_code_cell` functionality is ever used, the factory contract will become permanently unusable. 

For context, the `load_data` method, shown in Figure 4.1, defines the expected state structure: two addresses followed by two references to cells that contain initialization code.

```solidity
() load_data() impure inline {
    slice cs = get_data().begin_parse();
    storage::admin_address = cs~load_msg_addr();
    storage::withdrawer_address = cs~load_msg_addr();
    slice code_cs = cs~load_ref().begin_parse();
    storage::lp_wallet_code_cell = code_cs~load_ref();
    storage::init_code_cell = code_cs~load_ref();
    storage::liquidity_depository_code_cell = code_cs~load_ref();
    storage::pool_creator_code_cell = code_cs~load_ref();
    code_cs = cs~load_ref().begin_parse();
    storage::vault_code_dict = code_cs~load_dict();
    storage::pool_code_dict = code_cs~load_dict();
}
```

The `update_code_cell` helper function, shown in Figure 4.2, sets malformed data consisting of two addresses and one reference to a cell containing initialization code. Attempting to execute `load_data` after executing the `update_code_cell` function will result in an out-of-bounds reference error. Because `load_data` is called at the beginning of the `recv_internal` entrypoint function, all messages sent to this contract will fail, and the factory contract will become permanently unusable.

```solidity
() update_code_cell(cell code_cell) impure inline {
    set_data(
        begin_cell()
            .store_slice(storage::admin_address)
            .store_slice(storage::withdrawer_address)
            .store_ref(code_cell)
            .end_cell()
    );
}
```

## Exploit Scenario
Alice, a Swap Coﬀee admin, attempts to deploy a minor update to the `lp_wallet` code in the factory. She executes the `update_code_cell` opcode on the factory contract and supplies the new `lp_wallet` code in the message body. As a result, malformed data is set, and all subsequent messages to this contract will throw errors. The `internal_recv` function no longer works, and the factory is now unusable. The Swap Coﬀee protocol must be redeployed.

## Recommendations
- **Short term:** Add a second code cell argument to the `update_code_cell` function and save references to both. Additionally, add verification logic to ensure these two cells contain the correct number of initialization code references.
- **Long term:** Add tests for all administrative functions to check whether the system is in the expected state following privileged actions.

### Example 2

**Auto Label:** Misuse of memory instead of calldata leads to unintended memory modifications, data corruption, and increased attack surface due to mutable state and unsafe data handling.  

**Original Text Preview:**

##### Description

In the `CHNGovernance` contract in the `propose()`, and `_queueOrRevert()` functions, the memory keyword is used for parameters which are not modified instead of the calldata keyword. There is a similar scenario in the `queueTransaction()` function in the `CHNTimelock` contract.

##### Recommendation

Consider using the calldata keyword instead of the memory for function arguments which are not modified.

### Example 3

## Context
(No context files were provided by the reviewer)

## Summary
In the recursion VM, the LOADW and STOREW instructions are missing constraints to link the read value to the written value. As a result, a malicious prover can write any value.

## Finding Description
The `NativeLoadStoreCoreAir::eval` function does not constrain anything except the values of the instruction flags given the opcode. In particular, there is no constraint between `cols.data_read` and `cols.data_write`. Also, the `NativeLoadStoreAdapterAir` does not enforce any constraint between `ctx.reads.1` and `ctx.writes`.

## Impact Explanation
This lets a malicious prover write any value for any LOADW or STOREW instructions during the execution of the recursive verifier. This breaks soundness of the recursion VM.

## Likelihood Explanation
These instructions are used many times in the program, so we conclude that the likelihood of the prover being able to change the result of the execution (e.g., falsely "verifying" an invalid proof) is very high.

## Proof of Concept
The following patch adds a dummy instruction to the recursive verifier program (to keep the changes to witness generation self-contained), and then exploits it. In particular, the instruction should read from address `111111` (which in the beginning of the program has value `0`) and write it to the same address. Instead, it writes a different value.

## Recommendation
Since `cols.data_read` and `cols.data_write` should always be equal, they could in fact be the same columns.

## OpenVM
Fixed in commit `f038f61d`, the fix addresses the issue in `NativeLoadStoreAdapterAir` where the same columns were being used to constrain both the data read (when it exists, in the case of load store) and the data written.

## Cantina Managed
Fix verified.
