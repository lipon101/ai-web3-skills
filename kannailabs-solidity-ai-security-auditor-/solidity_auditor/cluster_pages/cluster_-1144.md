### Summary

The `NudgeCampaign::handleReallocation` function allows any attacker to manipulate reward allocations through flash loans or repeated calls with real fund via Li.Fi’s executor. This can lead to reward depletion and disruption of legitimate user rewards even after invalidating the attacker

### Vulnerability Details

The vulnerability stems from two main issues:

1. **Insufficient Caller Validation**: While the function checks for `SWAP_CALLER_ROLE`, this role is assigned to Li.Fi’s executor which can be called by anyone, effectively bypassing intended access controls.
2. **Reward Accounting Flaw**: The system fails to properly reset claimable amounts when participations are invalidated, allowing attackers to:

   * Claim all allocations through flash loans
   * Perform repeated reallocations via Li.Fi’s executor
   * Cause permanent reduction of available rewards through multiple invalidations

The `invalidateParticipations` function only subtracts from `pendingRewards` but doesn’t return the fees to the claimable pool, creating a growing discrepancy in reward accounting.

### Proof of Concept

Here is a test to prove this. This was run in mainnet fork. Since this will be deployed on Ethereum and other L2s in from the doc. Create a new test file and add this to the test suite `src/test/NudgeCampaignAttackTest.t.sol`.

* Gas used per attack: 432808
* Attack ran 157 times
* Total gas: `432808 * 157 = 67950856`
  With the current Ethereum gas price of 0.701 gwei per gas, it’ll cost 0.`701 * 67950856` gwei = 47633550.056 gwei
* This is 0.0476 Ether (Current Ether price is `$2087`). `2087 * 0.0476 = $99.34`
* It cost about `$99.34` in gas to launch the attack. This will be cheaper on L2, making this attack very possible.

### Impact

This vulnerability allows attackers to:

* Maliciously allocate campaign rewards through flash loans
* Perform denial-of-service attacks on legitimate users’ rewards
* Permanently reduce available rewards through repeated invalidations
* Disrupt the intended economic model of the campaign system

The attack could be executed at minimal cost and would be difficult to detect until rewards are significantly depleted.

### Tools Used

Foundry

### Recommended mitigation steps

Fix reward accounting:
```

function invalidateParticipations(uint256[] calldata pIDs) external onlyNudgeOperator {
    for (uint256 i = 0; i < pIDs.length; i++) {
        Participation storage participation = participations[pIDs[i]];

        if (participation.status != ParticipationStatus.PARTICIPATING) {
            continue;
        }

        participation.status = ParticipationStatus.INVALIDATED;
        uint256 totalReward = participation.rewardAmount +
                            (participation.rewardAmount * feeBasisPoints / BASIS_POINTS);
        pendingRewards -= participation.rewardAmount;
        claimableRewards += totalReward; // Add to claimable pool
    }
    emit ParticipationInvalidated(pIDs);
}
```

### Example 2

**Auto Label:** Arithmetic overflows and improper validation enable attackers to freeze funds or manipulate rewards, leading to loss of user assets and undermined incentive mechanisms.  

**Original Text Preview:**

The WstUSR vault allows users to deposit and withdraw within the same block. This enables malicious users to monitor the mempool and front-run the reward distribution by making a large deposit, and then withdrawing within the same block, which allows them to siphon off a portion of the rewards. To mitigate this vulnerability, consider enforcing a delay between deposits and withdrawals.

### Example 3

##### Description

In the `RewardDistributor` smart contract, functions like `updateEpoch` and `updateAccountReward` directly influence the financial integrity of the contract by affecting how rewards are computed and claimed. Leaving these functions without stringent access control or with restricted visibility could expose the contract to risks of state corruption or unintended financial discrepancies.

![Execution flow of `claimReward` function in `RewardDistributor` contract](https://halbornmainframe.com/proxy/audits/images/663aa272051a2fe55cbd3090)  

Both functions are called within the execution flow of the `claimReward` function in the `RewardDistributor`, and also in the `VeQoda` contract, which interacts with `RewardDistributor` through the `_updateReward` function, which calls `updateAccountReward` on each reward distributor registered in the `_rewardDistributors` set.

    function claimReward(address account, uint256 epochTarget) external {
        // Update unclaimed reward for an account before triggering reward transfer
        updateAccountReward(account, epochTarget);

        StakingStructs.AccountReward storage accountReward = accountRewards[account];
        if (accountReward.unclaimedReward > 0) {
            // Reset unclaimed reward before transfer to avoid re-entrancy attack
            uint256 reward = accountReward.unclaimedReward;

            IERC20(token).safeTransfer(account, reward);
            accountReward.claimedReward += reward;

    function updateEpoch(uint256 epochTarget) public {
        // Determine what epoch is current time in
        uint256 epochCurrentNew = getEpoch(block.timestamp);

        // If new epoch is on or before current epoch, either contract has not kick-started,
        // or this is not first interaction since epoch starts

            return;
        }

        // Epoch for current time now has surpassed target epoch, so limit epoch number
        if (epochCurrentNew > epochTarget) {
            epochCurrentNew = epochTarget;
        }

        // Take snapshot of total veToken since this is the first transaction in an epoch
        for (uint256 epoch = epochCurrent + 1; epoch <= epochCurrentNew;) {
            uint256 timeAtEpoch = getTimestamp(epoch);
            uint256 totalSupply = IVeQoda(veToken).totalVe(timeAtEpoch);

            emit EpochUpdate(epoch, timeAtEpoch, totalSupply);
        }
        epochCurrent = epochCurrentNew;
    }
```

  

From the code snippets of the `RewardDistributor` contract, it is possible to observe that the functions `updateEpoch` and `updateAccountRewards` are not supposed to be called alone, but within the execution of the `claimReward` function.

Likewise, in the `VeQoda` Token contract, when users are interacting with the `stake` and `unstake` functions, they will call the internal `_updateReward` function in the `VeQoda` contract, that subsequently performs an external call to the `updateAccountReward` public function in the `RewardDistributor` contract.

The identified vulnerabilities allow a malicious actor to invoke these unprotected functions arbitrarily, potentially leading to unauthorized manipulation of epoch management and reward calculations. This exploitation could result in several detrimental outcomes:

1. **Epoch Manipulation:** By calling `updateEpoch` without proper checks, an attacker could force the system into a new epoch prematurely, disrupting the intended timing for reward calculations and distributions. This premature transition could invalidate the correctness of ongoing epoch-based reward distributions, affecting all participating users.
2. **Reward Calculation Errors:** Unauthorized access to `updateAccountReward` could allow an attacker to repeatedly update reward accounts, potentially recalculating and claiming rewards based on manipulated or falsely reported staking data. This could lead to incorrect reward payouts, either denying rightful rewards to legitimate users or falsely inflating rewards to certain accounts.
3. **Impact on VeQoda Contract:** Since `VeQoda` relies on the integrity of the `RewardDistributor` for accurate veToken calculations and reward distributions, compromising the `RewardDistributor` directly affects the `VeQoda` contract's ability to maintain a reliable and trusted token supply and staking mechanism.
4. **Financial and Reputational Damage:** Beyond the immediate impact on token management and reward distributions, exploiting these vulnerabilities could lead to financial losses for users and damage the trust and reliability perceived in the platform, potentially causing long-term reputational harm to the project.
5. **System-Wide Inconsistencies:** Continuous exploitation of these vulnerabilities could lead to widespread inconsistencies across the staking and reward systems, making it challenging to restore integrity and confidence without significant rollback or system-wide updates, which may include pausing the contract, upgrading, or even a complete redeployment.

##### Proof of Concept

In order to reproduce this vulnerability, a simple call to `updateEpoch` and `updateAccountRewards` by a malicious actor would suffice to exploit the contract state and lead to undesired reward distribution and accounting.

**- Foundry test**

```
    function test_RewardDistributor_missing_access_control() public {
        vm.startPrank(seraph);
        /// calls `updateEpoch` with the current unix
        /// timestamp for the epoch.
        reward_distributor.updateEpoch(1715207594);
        /// calls `updateAccountReward` passing another
        /// user (ghost) and epoch `0` as parameters.
        reward_distributor.updateAccountReward(ghost, 0);
        vm.stopPrank();
    }
```

##### Recommendation

To completely address the current issue with access control, the following modifications are recommended:

1. Change the visibility modifier of the current `updateAccountReward` and `updateEpoch` functions to `internal` or `private`, and also rename the functions to `_updateAccountReward` and `_updateEpoch`, to keep consistency with general convention for `internal` or `private` functions.
2. Create two **new external functions (entry points)**, that will redirect incoming calls to the internal `_updateAccountReward` and `_updateReward` functions. Name these functions `updateAccountReward` and `updateEpoch`, and make sure that they can be externally called by the `VeQoda` contract. These external entry points must be access-controlled, so only authorized addresses (such as `VeQoda` token) can call it. Consider creating a modifier `onlyVeQoda` that will perform this verification.
