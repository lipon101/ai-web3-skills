# Cluster -1013

**Rank:** #98  
**Count:** 170  

## Label
Gauge state isn't updated when epochs change, so rewardRate and period guards fall out of sync, letting attackers seize or prematurely claim rewards while honest participants receive nothing.

## Examples

### Example 1

**Auto Label:** Failure to synchronize gauge state with reward indices leads to reward misallocation, loss of funds, and denial-of-service via unbounded or inconsistent reward distributions.  

**Original Text Preview:**

When a gauge is killed, its claimable rewards are transferred to the minter, and subsequent rewards are redirected there as well. However, if the gauge is later revived before `updateGauge()` is called, and an index update (via the public `notifyRewardAmount()` function) occurs just before that, rewards intended for the minter will become locked in the `Voter` contract.

This is because the `supplyIndex` is updated, but the gauge's state is not, preventing the proper distribution of these rewards.

```solidity
// reviveGauge() does not call updateGauge(), leading to locked rewards
function reviveGauge(address gauge) external onlyOwner {
    // missing: updateGauge(gauge);
    // ... revive logic ...
}
```

**Recommendations**

Modify the `reviveGauge()` function to call `updateGauge()` for the revived gauge.

### Example 2

**Auto Label:** Inconsistent reward timing and epoch handling lead to improper reward distribution, missed claims, and potential reward over-delivery or denial-of-service.  

**Original Text Preview:**

We have two different kinds of gauges according to different pools. When we notify rewards, the reward rate's calculation way is different.

In gauge, we will use `(_amount * PRECISION) / DURATION`. In CLGauge, we will use `rewardRate = amount / epochDurationLeft;`. The `epochDurationLeft` may be less than 1 week, depending on the different timestamp.

In voter, we have one function `distro`. It's possible that all gauges' rewards will be distributed in one transaction. This will cause that in CL Gauges, in the next 7 days, we will distribute rewards in one time slot, and in another time slot, we will not distribute any reward.

```solidity
    function notifyRewardAmount(
        uint256 _amount
    ) external onlyVoterOrAuthorized updateReward(address(0)) {
        _claimFees();
        // reword token is kitten.
        kitten.safeTransferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), _amount);
        // If last period is finished, we will start one new period.
        if (block.timestamp >= finishAt) {
            // PRECISION = 1e18
            rewardRate = (_amount * PRECISION) / DURATION;
        }
    }
    function notifyRewardAmount(uint256 amount) external nonReentrant {
        require(amount > 0);
        require(msg.sender == address(voter));
        _claimFees();
        // When we notify rewards, we need to update or accrue the previous rewards.
        pool.updateRewardsGrowthGlobal();
        address msgSender = msg.sender;
        uint256 timestamp = block.timestamp;
        // epoch remaining time.
        // epochDurationLeft may be less than 1 week.
        uint256 epochDurationLeft = ProtocolTimeLibrary.epochNext(timestamp) -
            timestamp;
        if (block.timestamp >= periodFinish) {
            rewardRate = amount / epochDurationLeft;
            pool.syncReward({
                rewardRate: rewardRate,
                rewardReserve: amount,
                periodFinish: nextPeriodFinish
            });
        }
    }
```

Recommendation: Suggest using a similar formula for the rewardRate calculation.

### Example 3

**Auto Label:** Premature reward claims due to insufficient period validation and flawed state timing, enabling attackers to extract rewards before distribution and disrupt reward integrity.

## Description

In VotingReward, voters can gain some rewards because of their vote. There are two kind of possible rewards in VotingReward.

1. Kitten token from voter.
2. Users can add some incentive tokens via function `incentivize`.

If users incentive some rewards via function `incentivize`, we will record these rewards in the next period. Users can vote for the related pool to get some rewards.

The problem here is that we miss one `_period` validation in function `getRewardForPeriod`. Users can get the future period's rewards.

Let's consider below scenario:

1. Alice incentives 500 USDC for next period, next period = X.
2. Bob as the first voter, votes for the related pool.
3. Bob gets rewards for the period X immediately. Currently, Bob is the only person who vote for this pool in this period. Bob will get all the rewards.

```solidity
    function incentivize(
        address _token,
        uint256 _amount
    ) external virtual nonReentrant {
        // Here we have one white list for token. So we cannot manipulate the token.
        if (voter.isWhitelisted(_token) == false)
            revert NotWhitelistedRewardToken();
        uint256 currentPeriod = getCurrentPeriod() + 1;
        uint256 amount = _addReward(currentPeriod, _token, _amount);
    }
    function _deposit(uint256 _amount, uint256 _tokenId) external onlyVoter {
        uint256 nextPeriod = getCurrentPeriod() + 1;

        tokenIdVotesInPeriod[nextPeriod][_tokenId] += _amount;
        totalVotesInPeriod[nextPeriod] += _amount;
    }
    function getRewardForPeriod(
        uint256 _period,
        uint256 _tokenId,
        address _token
    ) external nonReentrant {
        // Only owner or approved can get rewards.
        if (!veKitten.isApprovedOrOwner(msg.sender, _tokenId))
            revert NotApprovedOrOwner();
        _getReward(_period, _tokenId, _token, msg.sender);
    }
```

## Recommendations

Add one input parameter check, don't allow to get a reward from one future period.
