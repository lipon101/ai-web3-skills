**Rank:** #303  
**Count:** 24  

## Label
Neglecting to fully deactivate or withdraw from validators after slashing allows inactive validators to retain delegations, causing persistent exposure of staked funds and blocking withdrawals, which destabilizes liquidity and protocol operations.

## Description

The `StakingManager` contract manages staking operations and validator delegation in the HYPE staking system. When users stake HYPE tokens through the `stake()` function, the funds are distributed via the internal `_distributeStake()` function, which handles both buffer management and delegation to validators.

Currently, `_distributeStake()` delegates funds to the validator address returned by `validatorManager.getDelegation()` without verifying if that validator is still active. This creates a risk where user funds could be delegated to validators that have been deactivated due to slashing or poor performance.

```solidity
        if (amount > 0) {
            address delegateTo = validatorManager.getDelegation(address(this));
            require(delegateTo != address(0), "No delegation set");

            // Send tokens to delegation
            l1Write.sendTokenDelegate(delegateTo, uint64(amount), false);

            emit Delegate(delegateTo, amount);
        }
```

This could lead to:
1. User funds being delegated to inactive/slashed validators
2. Reduced returns for stakers as inactive validators won't generate rewards

### Proof of Concept

1. A validator is active and set as the current delegation target
2. The validator gets slashed and deactivated via `OracleManager.generatePerformance()`
3. A user calls `stake()` with 10 HYPE
4. `_distributeStake()` delegates the funds to the deactivated validator
5. The user's stake is now delegated to an inactive validator that won't generate rewards

## Recommendations

Add a validation check in `_distributeStake()` to verify the validator's active status before delegation.

## Description
`StakingManager.deactivateValidator()` creates a withdrawal request but does not undelegate/withdraw funds from validator by calling `processValidatorWithdrawals()`:
```solidity
    function deactivateValidator(address validator) external whenNotPaused nonReentrant validatorExists(validator) {
        // Oracle manager will also call this, so limit the msg.sender to both MANAGER_ROLE and ORACLE_ROLE
        require(hasRole(MANAGER_ROLE, msg.sender) || hasRole(ORACLE_ROLE, msg.sender), "Not authorized");

        (bool exists, uint256 index) = _validatorIndexes.tryGet(validator);
        require(exists, "Validator does not exist");

        Validator storage validatorData = _validators[index];
        require(validatorData.active, "Validator already inactive");

        // Create withdrawal request before state changes
        if (validatorData.balance > 0) {
            _addRebalanceRequest(validator, validatorData.balance);
        }

        // Update state after withdrawal request
        validatorData.active = false;

        emit ValidatorDeactivated(validator);
    }
```
Because of this issue, funds will stuck in the validator’s account:
1. Manager call to `closeRebalanceRequests()` to remove the rebalance request will revert because there is not enough balance in staking manager.
2. Manager call to `rebalanceWithdrawal()` will revert because the validator is added to the pending list.
3. Sentinel call to `requestEmergencyWithdrawal()` will revert too for the same reason

## Recommendations
In `deactivateValidator()` function, withdraw funds from validator by calling: 
```IStakingManager(stakingManager).processValidatorWithdrawals();```

### Example 3

**Auto Label:** Failure to validate validator active status leads to unauthorized operations, fund leakage, or state inconsistencies, enabling malicious or erroneous withdrawals and blocking critical system functions.  

**Original Text Preview:**

## Severity

**Impact:** High

**Likelihood:** Medium

## Description

`ValidatorManager._addRebalanceRequest()` checks validator's balance and records a withdrawal request:

```solidity
    function _addRebalanceRequest(address validator, uint256 withdrawalAmount) internal {
        require(!_validatorsWithPendingRebalance.contains(validator), "Validator has pending rebalance");
        require(withdrawalAmount > 0, "Invalid withdrawal amount");

        (bool exists, uint256 index) = _validatorIndexes.tryGet(validator);
        require(exists, "Validator does not exist");
        require(_validators[index].balance >= withdrawalAmount, "Insufficient balance");

        validatorRebalanceRequests[validator] = RebalanceRequest({validator: validator, amount: withdrawalAmount});
        _validatorsWithPendingRebalance.add(validator);

        emit RebalanceRequestAdded(validator, withdrawalAmount);
    }
```
However, a validator’s balance can change at any time due to rewards or slashing. This creates two potential problems when manager calls `closeRebalanceRequest()`:
1. Balance Decreases: If the validator’s balance decreases after the request is made, the delegation removal or withdrawal will fail.
2. Balance Increases: If the balance increases, some funds may remain in the validator’s account.

This is especially critical during emergency withdrawals or when deactivating a validator, as the manager needs to retrieve all funds.

## Recommendations

1. Ensure that the `closeRebalanceRequest()` function checks the validator’s balance to reflect the most up-to-date amount before processing the withdrawal request.
2. Add a mechanism to `closeRebalanceRequest()` so that manager can withdraw all available funds at the moment in validator balance
