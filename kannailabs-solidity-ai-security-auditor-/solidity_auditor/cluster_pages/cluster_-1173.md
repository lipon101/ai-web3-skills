## Description

The `StakingManager` contract implements a staking limit mechanism through the `stakingLimit` parameter to control the maximum amount of HYPE tokens that can be staked in the system. However, the current implementation fails to accurately track the actual amount of tokens under management due to not accounting for withdrawn tokens.

The `stake()` function performs a limit check using:

```solidity
require(totalStaked + msg.value <= stakingLimit, "Staking limit reached");
```

However, `totalStaked` is only incremented when users stake and never decremented, while a separate `totalClaimed` tracks withdrawals. This means the actual amount of tokens under management is `totalStaked - totalClaimed`, but the limit check uses the raw `totalStaked` value.

This creates a situation where the contract could reject new stakes even when the actual amount under management is well below the limit, effectively reducing the protocol's capacity unnecessarily.

### Proof of Concept

- Admin sets stakingLimit to 1000 HYPE
- Alice stakes 1000 HYPE (totalStaked = 1000)
- Alice withdraws 500 HYPE (totalClaimed = 500, totalStaked = 1000)
- Bob tries to stake 100 HYPE
- Transaction reverts due to "Staking limit reached" even though only 500 HYPE is actually staked

## Recommendations

Update the staking limit check in `stake()` to account for claimed tokens:

```solidity
require(((totalStaked - totalClaimed) + msg.value) <= stakingLimit, "Staking limit reached");
```

### Example 2

**Auto Label:** Improper limit validation due to flawed state tracking, leading to unjustified rejections of stakes and asset locking.  

**Original Text Preview:**

## Severity

**Impact:** Medium

**Likelihood:** Medium

## Description

The `StakingManager` contract implements staking limits through three key parameters:
- `stakingLimit`: Maximum total stake allowed (0 = unlimited)
- `minStakeAmount`: Minimum stake per transaction
- `maxStakeAmount`: Maximum stake per transaction (0 = unlimited)

These parameters can be configured by accounts with the `MANAGER_ROLE` through dedicated setter functions. However, there is a logical error in the `setMaxStakeAmount()` function that prevents setting a valid max stake amount when there is no staking limit configured.

```solidity
        if (newMaxStakeAmount > 0) {
            require(newMaxStakeAmount > minStakeAmount, "Max stake must be greater than min");
            require(newMaxStakeAmount < stakingLimit, "Max stake must be less than limit");
        }
```

The issue occurs in the validation logic of `setMaxStakeAmount()`, where it unconditionally requires that any non-zero `newMaxStakeAmount` must be less than `stakingLimit`. This check fails to account for the case where `stakingLimit` is 0 (unlimited), making it impossible to set a max stake amount when no total limit exists. 

### Proof of Concept

1. Initially `stakingLimit = 0` (unlimited total staking)
2. Manager attempts to set `maxStakeAmount = 100 ether` to limit individual transactions
3. The call to `setMaxStakeAmount(100 ether)` reverts because:
   - `newMaxStakeAmount > 0` triggers the validation checks
   - `require(newMaxStakeAmount < stakingLimit)` fails as `100 ether < 0` is false

## Recommendations

Modify the `setMaxStakeAmount()` function to only perform the staking limit validation when a limit is actually set:

```solidity
function setMaxStakeAmount(uint256 newMaxStakeAmount) external onlyRole(MANAGER_ROLE) {
    if (newMaxStakeAmount > 0) {
        require(newMaxStakeAmount > minStakeAmount, "Max stake must be greater than min");
        if (stakingLimit > 0) {
            require(newMaxStakeAmount < stakingLimit, "Max stake must be less than limit");
        }
    }
    maxStakeAmount = newMaxStakeAmount;
    emit MaxStakeAmountUpdated(newMaxStakeAmount);
}
```

The [`SwapProxy` contract](https://github.com/across-protocol/contracts/blob/b84dbfae35030e0f2caa5509b632c10106a32330/contracts/SpokePoolPeriphery.sol#L26) contains the [`performSwap` function](https://github.com/across-protocol/contracts/blob/b84dbfae35030e0f2caa5509b632c10106a32330/contracts/SpokePoolPeriphery.sol#L67), which allows the caller to execute a swap in two ways: [by approving or sending tokens to the specified exchange](https://github.com/across-protocol/contracts/blob/b84dbfae35030e0f2caa5509b632c10106a32330/contracts/SpokePoolPeriphery.sol#L81-L84), or by [approving tokens through the `Permit2` contract](https://github.com/across-protocol/contracts/blob/b84dbfae35030e0f2caa5509b632c10106a32330/contracts/SpokePoolPeriphery.sol#L86-L101). However, since it is possible to supply any address as the `exchange` parameter and any call data through the `routerCalldata` parameter of the `performSwap` function, the `SwapProxy` contract may be forced to perform an [arbitrary call to an arbitrary address](https://github.com/across-protocol/contracts/blob/b84dbfae35030e0f2caa5509b632c10106a32330/contracts/SpokePoolPeriphery.sol#L108).

This could be exploited by an attacker, who could force the `SwapProxy` contract to call the [`invalidateNonces` function](https://github.com/Uniswap/permit2/blob/cc56ad0f3439c502c246fc5cfcc3db92bb8b7219/src/AllowanceTransfer.sol#L113) of the `Permit2` contract, specifying an arbitrary spender and a nonce higher than the current one. As a result, the nonce for the given (token, spender) pair will be [updated](https://github.com/Uniswap/permit2/blob/cc56ad0f3439c502c246fc5cfcc3db92bb8b7219/src/AllowanceTransfer.sol#L124). If the `performSwap` function is called again later, it [will attempt to use a subsequent nonce](https://github.com/across-protocol/contracts/blob/b84dbfae35030e0f2caa5509b632c10106a32330/contracts/SpokePoolPeriphery.sol#L95), which has been invalidated by the attacker and the code inside `Permit2` will [revert due to nonces mismatch](https://github.com/Uniswap/permit2/blob/cc56ad0f3439c502c246fc5cfcc3db92bb8b7219/src/AllowanceTransfer.sol#L138).

As the `performSwap` function is the only place where the nonce passed to the `Permit2` contract is updated, the possibility of swapping a given token on a certain exchange will be blocked forever, which impacts all the functions of the [`SpokePoolPeriphery` contract](https://github.com/across-protocol/contracts/blob/b84dbfae35030e0f2caa5509b632c10106a32330/contracts/SpokePoolPeriphery.sol#L140) related to swapping tokens. The attack may be performed for many different (tokens, exchange) pairs.

Consider not allowing the `exchange` parameter to be equal to the `Permit2` contract address.
