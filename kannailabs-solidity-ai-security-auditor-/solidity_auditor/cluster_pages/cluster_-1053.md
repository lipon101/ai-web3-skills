**Rank:** #165  
**Count:** 79  

## Label
Omitting initialization guards on internal or deployment hooks lets attackers reinitialize or misconfigure tokens and proxies (root cause), enabling governance bypass to seize assets, freeze funds, or hijack ownership (impact).

## Examples

### Example 1

**Auto Label:** Failure to enforce initialization or finalization states allows unauthorized state modifications, leading to unintended behavior, loss of funds, or compromised immutability in critical contract operations.  

**Original Text Preview:**

The `internal` function `_init` within `ERC721WithURIBuilderUpgradeable.sol` lacks the `onlyInitializing` modifier. This function is called by the `initializer` function (`init`) of the upgradeable implementation contract `PositionsManager.sol`.

While the main `PositionsManager.init` function _is_ protected by the `initializer` modifier, and the underlying `__ERC721_init` called by `_init` also has protection, the absence of the guard on `_init` itself poses a latent risk. If future upgrades to `PositionsManager` were to introduce new functions that mistakenly call `_init` again after initial deployment, there would be no direct protection at the `_init` level to prevent this call attempt.

Recommendation:

Add the `onlyInitializing` modifier to the `ERC721WithURIBuilderUpgradeable._init` function to explicitly enforce its initialization-only context and adhere to standard upgradeable contract patterns.

```solidity
    function _init(string memory name_, string memory symbol_) internal onlyInitializing {
        __ERC721_init(name_, symbol_);
    }
```

### Example 2

**Auto Label:** Hardcoded seeds and missing access control enable unauthorized initialization, allowing attackers to seize governance authority and manipulate system state.  

**Original Text Preview:**

The following unresolved `TODOs` introduce crucial issues in deployment and configuration logic:

1. Hardcoded `address(0)` as a proxy admin in `DeployUsdxlUtils._deployGsm()`. Currently, the proxy admin is hardcoded as `address(0)`, meaning no one can manage upgrades or administrative functions of the proxy.

```solidity
//File: (usdxl-core) src/deployments/utils/DeployUsdxlUtils.sol

function _deployGsm() internal returns (address) {
    AdminUpgradeabilityProxy proxy = new AdminUpgradeabilityProxy(
        address(gsmImpl),
@>      address(0), // TODO: set admin to timelock
        ""
    );
    --- SNIPPED ---
}
```

2. Duplicate strategy contracts in `DeployHyFiConfigEngine._getUniqueStrategiesOnPool()`.

```solidity
//File: (hypurrfi-deployment) script/DeployHyFiConfigEngine.s.sol

library DeployRatesFactoryLib {
@>   // TODO check also by param, potentially there could be different contracts, but with exactly same params
    function _getUniqueStrategiesOnPool(IPool pool, address[] memory reservesToSkip) {...}
```

The function currently checks for duplicate strategies only by contract address, but not by actual parameters. However, in `V3RateStrategyFactory.initialize()`, strategies are identified using a hash of their parameters. This means the same configuration can be registered multiple times under different contracts, leading to unnecessary duplication.

```solidity
//File: (hypurrfi-deployment) lib/aave-helpers/src/v3-config-engine/V3RateStrategyFactory.sol

function initialize(IDefaultInterestRateStrategy[] memory liveStrategies) external initializer {
for (uint256 i = 0; i < liveStrategies.length; i++) {
    RateStrategyParams memory params = getStrategyData(liveStrategies[i]);

    bytes32 hashedParams = strategyHashFromParams(params);

@>  _strategyByParamsHash[hashedParams] = address(liveStrategies[i]);
@>  _strategies.push(address(liveStrategies[i]));

    emit RateStrategyCreated(address(liveStrategies[i]), hashedParams, params);
}
}
```

Recommendation

- For `DeployUsdxlUtils._deployGsm()` function:
  If the proxy admin is meant to be a contract (such as a timelock contract), deploy it as part of the script and assign it properly. Otherwise, pass the proxy admin address as a parameter to `_deployGsm()` instead of hardcoding `address(0)`.

- For `DeployHyFiConfigEngine._getUniqueStrategiesOnPool()`:
  Before adding a new unique strategy, check if another strategy with the same parameters already exists.

### Example 3

**Auto Label:** Failure to enforce proper initialization or ownership transfer leads to unauthorized control, arbitrary parameter setting, or missing governance oversight, enabling attackers to manipulate contract state or exploit governance gaps.  

**Original Text Preview:**

The `_deployUsdxl()` function is designed to deploy the **usdxl token** and the required contracts to initialize the **usdx reserve**, however, it was noticed that when the **`usdxlAToken`** is deployed, it is not initialized in the script, which allows any malicious actor to initialize it with unintended, incorrect, or irrelevant parameters as the `usdxlAToken.initialize()` function is unrestrictred.

Recommendation: ensure that the **`usdxlAToken`** is properly initialized within the script during the deployment process.
