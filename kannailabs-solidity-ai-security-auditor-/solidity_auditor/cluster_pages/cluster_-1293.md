# Cluster -1293

**Rank:** #26  
**Count:** 695  

## Label
Unchecked arithmetic operations and casts allow intermediate multiplications or type conversions to overflow unwatched, causing transactions to revert or corrupt balances and creating exploitable integrity gaps in financial state transitions.

## Examples

### Example 1

**Auto Label:** Unsafe arithmetic operations without overflow/underflow checks lead to incorrect state updates, enabling data corruption, unauthorized access, or exploitable behavior through arithmetic wrapping.  

**Original Text Preview:**

In the [`_swapAndBridge` function](https://github.com/across-protocol/contracts/blob/b84dbfae35030e0f2caa5509b632c10106a32330/contracts/SpokePoolPeriphery.sol#L575), the adjusted output amount is [calculated](https://github.com/across-protocol/contracts/blob/b84dbfae35030e0f2caa5509b632c10106a32330/contracts/SpokePoolPeriphery.sol#L604-L606) as the product of `depositData.outputAmount` and `returnAmount` divided by `minExpectedInputTokenAmount`. If `depositData.outputAmount * returnAmount` exceeds `2^256–1`, the transaction will revert immediately on the multiply step, even when the eventual division result would fit. This intermediate overflow is invisible to users, who only see a generic failure without an explanatory error message.

Consider using OpenZeppelin’s [`Math.mulDiv(a, b, c)`](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/blob/48bd2864c6c696bf424ee0e2195f2d72ddd1a86c/contracts/utils/math/Math.sol#L204) to compute `floor(a*b/c)` without intermediate overflow. Alternatively, consider documenting the possible overflow scenario.

***Update:** Resolved in [pull request #1020](https://github.com/across-protocol/contracts/pull/1020) at commit [`e872f04`](https://github.com/across-protocol/contracts/pull/1020/commits/e872f045bd2bbdb42d8ca74c2133d0afa63ae07b) by documenting the potential overflow scenario.*

### Example 2

**Auto Label:** Unsafe arithmetic operations without overflow/underflow checks lead to incorrect state updates, enabling data corruption, unauthorized access, or exploitable behavior through arithmetic wrapping.  

**Original Text Preview:**

In the CLGauge contract, both the `deposit` and `withdraw` functions perform unsafe type casting from `uint128` to `int128` when interacting with the pool's stake function. If the liquidity value is large (exceeding 2^127-1), this conversion could result in overflow, leading to incorrect liquidity values being staked or withdrawn from the pool.

```solidity
    function deposit(
        uint256 nfpTokenId,
        uint256 tokenId
    ) public lock actionLock {
        ...
        // stake nfp liquidity in pool
        pool.stake(int128(_liquidity), _tickLower, _tickUpper, true); // @audit unsafe cast to int128 can lead to overflow
        ...
    }
```

```solidity
    function withdraw(uint nfpTokenId) public lock actionLock {
        ...
        if (_liquidity != 0)
            pool.stake(-int128(_liquidity), _tickLower, _tickUpper, true); // @audit unsafe cast to int128 can lead to overflow
        ...
    }
```

It's recommended to use SafeCast library to cast liquidity to int128.
