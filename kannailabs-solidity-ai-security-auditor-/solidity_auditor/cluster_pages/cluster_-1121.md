# Cluster -1121

**Rank:** #351  
**Count:** 17  

## Label
Failing to validate or refresh indexes when asset or distribution metadata changes leaves caches or events stale, so on-chain handlers process incorrect assets, misallocate funds, and expose misleading integration data.

## Cluster Information
- **Total Findings:** 17

## Examples

### Example 1

**Auto Label:** Failure to validate inputs or maintain consistent state leads to incorrect asset handling, fund loss, or erroneous accounting due to unverified assumptions, inconsistent indexing, or redundant state variables.

## Severity

**Impact:** High

**Likelihood:** Low

## Description

The `updateBitFlag` function allows the basket's asset list to be updated, with the restriction that the new `bitFlag` must be a superset of the previous `bitFlag`. During the `updateBitFlag` process, if all validations pass, the function iterates over the new asset list and updates `basketAssetToIndexPlusOne`. However, it does not update `basketTokenToBaseAssetIndexPlusOne`.

Updating a `bitFlag` that is a superset of the previous `bitFlag` can still potentially impact `basketTokenToBaseAssetIndexPlusOne`. Consider the following scenario:

1. The current bitFlag is `1110`, meaning the asset list contains three assets. In this scenario, the first asset in the returned array is set as `basketTokenToBaseAssetIndexPlusOne`, resulting in a value of 1 (0 + 1).
2. The new bitFlag is `1111`, which is a superset of the previous `bitFlag`. The asset list now contains four assets. However, since `basketTokenToBaseAssetIndexPlusOne` has not been updated, the base asset index will point to the newly included asset. This causes all functions relying on this index to process the wrong asset.

## Recommendations

Consider updating `basketTokenToBaseAssetIndexPlusOne` when `updateBitFlag` is called.

### Example 2

**Auto Label:** Inaccurate state updates and improper validation lead to flawed fund allocations, misleading event data, and persistent invalid entries, compromising auditability, consistency, and correct fund distribution.  

**Original Text Preview:**

## Vulnerability Details

The distributePoints() function calculates the correct amount of variables for points distribution and emits the PointsDistributed event. According to the documentation, the first argument of the event should be 'the total number of points distributed.' There is a storage variable that holds this number.

```Solidity
FjordPoints::distributePoints()

totalPoints = totalPoints.add(pointsPerEpoch * weeksPending);
```

However, instead of totalPoints, pointsPerEpoch is used as the points parameter.

```Solidity
FjordPoints::distributePoints()

emit PointsDistributed(pointsPerEpoch, pointsPerToken);
```

## Impact

Frontend or other off-chain services may display incorrect values, potentially misleading users.

## Tools Used

Manual

## Recommendations

Use `totalPoints` instead of `pointsPerEpoch`.

### Example 3

**Auto Label:** Inaccurate state updates and improper validation lead to flawed fund allocations, misleading event data, and persistent invalid entries, compromising auditability, consistency, and correct fund distribution.

Within the `YRizStrategy` contract, the [`getAllPoolDistributions` function](https://github.com/radiant-capital/riz/blob/65ca7bb55550d30388e2b2277fefe5686ab7e4e8/src/vaults/YRizStrategy.sol#L178) may return data which is not useful. This data could be interpreted incorrectly by contracts that call the `getAllDistributions` function and lead to unexpected behavior.


The problem arises when an element of the `_distributions` mapping has the [`pool` value set to `0`](https://github.com/radiant-capital/riz/blob/65ca7bb55550d30388e2b2277fefe5686ab7e4e8/src/vaults/YRizStrategy.sol#L182). This should generally correspond to an invalid or uninitialized distribution. Once this is detected, the loop which is [constructing the return value](https://github.com/radiant-capital/riz/blob/65ca7bb55550d30388e2b2277fefe5686ab7e4e8/src/vaults/YRizStrategy.sol#L181) of `getAllPoolDistributions` will [break](https://github.com/radiant-capital/riz/blob/65ca7bb55550d30388e2b2277fefe5686ab7e4e8/src/vaults/YRizStrategy.sol#L183), but crucially, the [returned `distributions` array](https://github.com/radiant-capital/riz/blob/65ca7bb55550d30388e2b2277fefe5686ab7e4e8/src/vaults/YRizStrategy.sol#L186) will contain the invalid configuration at its end. Note that this is only the case if the `_distributions` array contains [less than `maxRizPools` number of configurations](https://github.com/radiant-capital/riz/blob/65ca7bb55550d30388e2b2277fefe5686ab7e4e8/src/vaults/YRizStrategy.sol#L180-L181).In this case, an invalid set of `Distribution`s will be returned, which may result in an integration misinterpreting this as correct data.


Consider first checking [whether the `_distributions` element is initialized](https://github.com/radiant-capital/riz/blob/65ca7bb55550d30388e2b2277fefe5686ab7e4e8/src/vaults/YRizStrategy.sol#L182-L184), and then [writing to `distributions`](https://github.com/radiant-capital/riz/blob/65ca7bb55550d30388e2b2277fefe5686ab7e4e8/src/vaults/YRizStrategy.sol#L181), rather than doing it in the opposite order.


***Update:** Resolved in [pull request \#52](https://github.com/radiant-capital/riz/pull/52). The Radiant team stated:*



> *Added a variable which will hold all the valid distributions. We loop through those instead of the max Riz pools.*
