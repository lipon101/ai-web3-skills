## Description

The `_bridge()` and `_quote()` in the `MultiChainHyperlaneTellerWithMultiAssetSupport` contract fail to apply a custom post-dispatch hook set via the `setHook()`. Instead, they rely on the overloaded `Mailbox.dispatch()`, which defaults to using the Mailbox contract's defaultHook.

```solidity
function _bridge(uint256 shareAmount, BridgeData calldata data) internal override returns (bytes32 messageId) {
--- SNIPPED ---
    mailbox.dispatch{ value: msg.value }(
        data.chainSelector, // must be `destinationDomain` on hyperlane
        msgRecipient, // must be the teller address left-padded to bytes32
        _payload,
        StandardHookMetadata.overrideGasLimit(data.messageGas) // Sets the refund address to msg.sender, sets
            // `_msgValue`
            // to zero
    );
}
```

The `Mailbox.dispatch()` has three overloaded variants. In this case, the `_bridge()` invokes the version without specifying a custom IPostDispatchHook, causing the `Mailbox` contract to automatically apply with its `defaultHook`.

```solidity
// hyperlane-monorepo/solidity/contracts/Mailbox.sol
function dispatch(
    uint32 destinationDomain,
    bytes32 recipientAddress,
    bytes calldata messageBody,
    bytes calldata hookMetadata
) external payable override returns (bytes32) {
    return
        dispatch(
            destinationDomain,
            recipientAddress,
            messageBody,
            hookMetadata,
@>          defaultHook
        );
}
```

Consequently, the `MultiChainHyperlaneTellerWithMultiAssetSupport` opts to use a custom post-dispatch hook instead of the `Mailbox` contract's default, the custom hook is not invoked during the dispatch process. This could result in incorrect or unintended post-dispatch handling.

```solidity
// hyperlane-monorepo/solidity/contracts/Mailbox.sol
function dispatch(
    uint32 destinationDomain,
    bytes32 recipientAddress,
    bytes calldata messageBody,
    bytes calldata metadata,
    IPostDispatchHook hook
) public payable virtual returns (bytes32) {
    if (address(hook) == address(0)) {
        hook = defaultHook;
    }
--- SNIPPED ---
    requiredHook.postDispatch{value: requiredValue}(metadata, message);
@>  hook.postDispatch{value: msg.value - requiredValue}(metadata, message);

    return id;
}
```

Note that this issue also arises with the `_quote()` that can lead to incorrect fee estimation.

## Recommendations

Consider using the overloaded `dispatch()` method in the `Mailbox` contract that accepts a custom hook.

This approach will handle both cases where a hook is set and not set because it will also default to using the `defaultHook` if the protocol decides to leave the hook as the zero address.

Please note that the custom hooks should be compatible with the Hyperlane standard hook.

```diff
function _bridge(uint256 shareAmount, BridgeData calldata data) internal override returns (bytes32 messageId) {
--- SNIPPED ---
    mailbox.dispatch{ value: msg.value }(
        data.chainSelector, // must be `destinationDomain` on hyperlane
        msgRecipient, // must be the teller address left-padded to bytes32
        _payload,
-       StandardHookMetadata.overrideGasLimit(data.messageGas) // Sets the refund address to msg.sender, sets
-            // `_msgValue`
-            // to zero
+       StandardHookMetadata.overrideGasLimit(data.messageGas),
+       hook        
    );
}
```

### Example 2

**Auto Label:** Failure to validate or verify recipient/authority/contract existence leads to unauthorized delegation, asset mismanagement, or incorrect execution, enabling loss of control or irreversible protocol errors.  

**Original Text Preview:**

##### Description
This issue has been identified within the `_delegateStake` function of the `HookTargetStakeDelegator` contract.
The function directly calls `rewardVault.delegateStake(...)` without first verifying whether the `rewardVault` contract has been successfully deployed. In edge cases such as when deployment is asynchronous or delayed this may lead to unexpected reverts and disrupt protocol execution.
<br/>
##### Recommendation
We recommend adding a check to confirm the existence of the `rewardVault` contract (e.g., using `extcodesize`) before attempting to delegate stake. If the contract is not yet deployed, the function should simply skip delegation to maintain protocol continuity.

### Example 3

**Auto Label:** Failure to validate or verify recipient/authority/contract existence leads to unauthorized delegation, asset mismanagement, or incorrect execution, enabling loss of control or irreversible protocol errors.  

**Original Text Preview:**

## Summary

The `delegateBoost()` function **does not validate the recipient (`to`) properly**, allowing users to **delegate boosts to unverified addresses**. This could lead to **boosts being sent to malicious contracts, ineffective delegations, or self-delegations**, breaking the system’s integrity.

## Vulnerability Details

Vulnerable Code:

```Solidity
function delegateBoost(
    address to,
    uint256 amount,
    uint256 duration
) external override nonReentrant {
    if (paused()) revert EmergencyPaused();
    if (to == address(0)) revert InvalidPool();  // Only checks for `0x0`
    if (amount == 0) revert InvalidBoostAmount();
    if (duration < MIN_DELEGATION_DURATION || duration > MAX_DELEGATION_DURATION) 
        revert InvalidDelegationDuration();

    uint256 userBalance = IERC20(address(veToken)).balanceOf(msg.sender);
    if (userBalance < amount) revert InsufficientVeBalance();

    // No verification if `to` is a valid recipient
}

```

**Problems**

* **A user can delegate to an unverified or malicious contract**, which could **steal or misuse the boost**.
* **No check to prevent self-delegation**, leading to **ineffective boosts**.
* **Boosts can be locked in contracts that do not support retrieval**, permanently losing voting power.

## Impact

* **Boosts can be lost forever** if sent to a **malicious contract or an invalid address**.

- **Users could self-delegate, causing ineffective boost calculations.**
- **Boost system integrity is compromised, allowing abuse.**

## Tools Used

Manual review

## Recommendations

* **Ensure that** **`to`** **is a valid pool using** **`supportedPools[to]`.**

- **Prevent self-delegation.**

```Solidity
function delegateBoost(
    address to,
    uint256 amount,
    uint256 duration
) external override nonReentrant {
    if (paused()) revert EmergencyPaused();
    if (!supportedPools[to]) revert PoolNotSupported();  // Ensure recipient is a valid pool
    if (msg.sender == to) revert CannotSelfDelegate();  // Prevent self-delegation

    // ..
}

```
