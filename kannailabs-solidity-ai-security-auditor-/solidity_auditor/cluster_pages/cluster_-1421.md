## Description

`GatewayRegistry` contract allows users to register and stake tokens into gateways to receive computation units CUs. First, the user registers a gateway,

```solidity
  function register(bytes calldata peerId, string memory metadata, address gatewayAddress) public whenNotPaused {
    require(peerId.length > 0, "Cannot set empty peerId");
    bytes32 peerIdHash = keccak256(peerId);
    require(gateways[peerIdHash].operator == address(0), "PeerId already registered");

    gateways[peerIdHash] = Gateway({
      operator: msg.sender,
      peerId: peerId,
      strategy: defaultStrategy,
      ownAddress: gatewayAddress,
      metadata: metadata,
      totalStaked: 0,
>>    totalUnstaked: 0
    });
```

note `totalUnstaked` is set to 0. After this we can stake tokens

```solidity
  function _stakeWithoutTransfer(bytes calldata peerId, uint256 amount, uint128 durationBlocks) internal {
    (Gateway storage gateway, bytes32 peerIdHash) = _getGateway(peerId);
    _requireOperator(gateway);

    uint256 _computationUnits = computationUnitsAmount(amount, durationBlocks);
    uint128 lockStart = router.networkController().nextEpoch();
    uint128 lockEnd = lockStart + durationBlocks;
>>  stakes[peerIdHash].push(Stake(amount, _computationUnits, lockStart, lockEnd));
```

`stakes` mapping is used to track all user stakes. The problem arises when we unregister the gateway, we do not delete the `stakes`, it can be exploited in the following steps:

- unstake tokens from the gateway
- unregister gateway
- register new gateway with the same `peerId`
- since `totalUnstaked = 0`, we can unstake tokens again

```solidity
  function _unstakeable(Gateway storage gateway) internal view returns (uint256) {
    Stake[] memory _stakes = stakes[keccak256(gateway.peerId)];
    uint256 blockNumber = block.number;
    uint256 total = 0;
    for (uint256 i = 0; i < _stakes.length; i++) {
      Stake memory _stake = _stakes[i];
      if (_stake.lockEnd <= blockNumber) {
        total += _stake.amount;
      }
    }
    return total - gateway.totalUnstaked;
  }
```

Here is the coded POC for `GatewayRegistry.unstake.t.sol `

```solidity
  function test_StealStakes() public {
    uint256 amount = 100;
    address alice = address(0xA11cE);
    token.transfer(alice, amount);

    // stakers stake into their gateways
    gatewayRegistry.stake(peerId, amount, 200);
    vm.startPrank(alice);
    token.approve(address(gatewayRegistry), type(uint256).max);
    gatewayRegistry.register(bytes("alice"), "", address(0x6a7e));
    gatewayRegistry.stake(bytes("alice"), amount, 200);

    assertEq(token.balanceOf(address(gatewayRegistry)), 200);
    // exploit
    vm.roll(block.number + 300);
    gatewayRegistry.unstake(bytes("alice"), amount);
    gatewayRegistry.unregister(bytes("alice"));
    gatewayRegistry.register(bytes("alice"), "", address(0x6a7e));
    // unstake again
    gatewayRegistry.unstake(bytes("alice"), amount);
    assertEq(token.balanceOf(address(gatewayRegistry)), 0);
  }
```

## Recommendations

Delete `stakes` mapping when gateway is being unregistered.

## Description

The `RivusCOMAIN::approveMultipleUnstakes` function allows users with the `hasApproveWithdrawalRole` role to approve `requestUnstake` requests and send the requested `wCOMAIN` assets. Users can then call the `RivusCOMAIN::unstake` function to receive the corresponding `wCOMAIN` tokens.

The issue arises because fees can change between the approval of `requestUnstake` and when users perform `unstake`, affecting the actual amount required. Consider the following scenario:

1. A `requestUnstake` for `1 wCOMAI` in exchange for `1 rsCOMAI` is made.
2. The manager approves the request and calculates the `wCOMAI` amount required to be sent to the contract using the `getWCOMAIByrsCOMAIAfterFee` function in line `RivusCOMAI#L724`:

```solidity
File: RivusCOMAI.sol
681:   function approveMultipleUnstakes(UserRequest[] calldata requests)
682:     public
683:     hasApproveWithdrawalRole
684:     nonReentrant
685:     checkPaused
686:   {
...
...
702:     // Loop through each request to unstake and check if the request is valid
703:     for (uint256 i = 0; i < requests.length; i++) {
...
...
724:       (uint256 wcomaiAmt,,uint256 unstakingFeeAmt) = getWCOMAIByrsCOMAIAfterFee(unstakeRequests[request.user][request.requestIndex].comaiAmt);
725:       totalRequiredComaiAmt = totalRequiredComaiAmt + wcomaiAmt + unstakingFeeAmt;
726:     }
...
...
741:     // Transfer the COMAI from the withdrawal manager to this contract
742:     require(
743:       IERC20(commonWrappedToken).transferFrom(
744:         msg.sender,
745:         address(this),
746:         totalRequiredComaiAmt
747:       ),
748:       "comaiAmt transfer failed"
749:     );
...
...
760:   }
```

```solidity
File: RivusCOMAI.sol
476:   function getWCOMAIByrsCOMAIAfterFee(uint256 rsCOMAIAmount)
477:     public
478:     view
479:     returns (uint256, uint256, uint256)
480:   {
481:     uint256 unstakingFeeAmt = rsCOMAIAmount * unstakingFee / 1000;
482:     uint256 bridgingFeeAmt = rsCOMAIAmount * bridgingFee / 1000;
483:     if(bridgingFeeAmt < 1 * (10 ** decimals())) bridgingFeeAmt = 1 * (10 ** decimals());
484:     uint256 unstakingAmt = rsCOMAIAmount - bridgingFeeAmt - unstakingFeeAmt;
485:     return (unstakingAmt, bridgingFeeAmt, unstakingFeeAmt);
486:   }
```

3. Fees are then changed using the `RivusCOMAI::setUnstakingFee` and `RivusCOMAI::setBridgingFee` functions.
4. The user with the approved `requestUnstake` calls the `RivusCOMAI::unstake` function, which again calls the `getWCOMAIByrsCOMAIAfterFee` function in line `RivusCOMAI#L781`, resulting in different fees due to the changes made in `step 3`:

```solidity
File: RivusCOMAI.sol
770:   function unstake(uint256 requestIndex) public nonReentrant checkPaused {
771:
772:     require(
773:       requestIndex < unstakeRequests[msg.sender].length,
774:       "Invalid request index"
775:     );
776:     UnstakeRequest memory request = unstakeRequests[msg.sender][requestIndex];
777:     require(request.amount > 0, "No unstake request found");
778:     require(request.isReadyForUnstake, "Unstake not approved yet");
779:
780:     // Transfer wCOMAI tokens back to the user
781:     (uint256 amountToTransfer,,uint256 unstakingFeeAmt) = getWCOMAIByrsCOMAIAfterFee(request.comaiAmt);
782:     _transferToVault(address(this), unstakingFeeAmt);
783:
784:     // Update state to false
785:     delete unstakeRequests[msg.sender][requestIndex];
786:
787:     // Perform ERC20 transfer
788:     bool transferSuccessful = IERC20(request.wrappedToken).transfer(
789:       msg.sender,
790:       amountToTransfer
791:     );
792:     require(transferSuccessful, "wCOMAI transfer failed");
793:
794:     // Process the unstake event
795:     emit UserUnstake(msg.sender, requestIndex, block.timestamp);
796:   }
```

5. The amount transferred to the user may be incorrect due to the fee changes, leading to insufficient `wCOMAI` deposited by the manager in `step 2`.

This inconsistency can cause some unstake operations to fail because the correct amount of `wCOMAI` was not deposited into the `RivusCOMAI` contract via `approveMultipleUnstakes()`.

## Recommendations

It is recommended to calculate the fees and wrapped token amounts during the `RivusCOMAI::requestUnstake` function, similar to how it is done in `RivusTAO::requestUnstake#L572`. This way, the same `wCOMAI` and `unstakingFees` values are used consistently in both the `approveMultipleUnstakes()` and `unstake()` functions.

## Medium Risk Report

### Severity
Medium Risk

### Context
StakingAccountant.sol#L142-L147

### Description
The exchange rate of kHYPE is calculated based on the total amounts of all StakingManagers in the system.

```solidity
uint256 rewardsAmount = validatorManager.totalRewards();
uint256 slashingAmount = validatorManager.totalSlashing();
uint256 totalHYPE = totalStaked + rewardsAmount - totalClaimed - slashingAmount; // <<<
// Calculate ratio with 18 decimals precision
return Math.mulDiv(totalHYPE, 1e18, kHYPESupply);
```

Those StakingManager contracts may delegate funds to different validators. Since there is no way to move liquidity between the StakingManagers, there could be a lack of liquidity in case users want to exit StakingManager, as they may not have enough funds on their validator's balance.

To explain the problem, an example is given:
- Suppose that StakingManager1 staked 100 Hype to validator1 and earned 5 Hype in rewards, but StakingManager2 staked 100 Hype to validator2 and earned 15 Hype as rewards. Thus, according to the exchange ratio formula, both StakingManagers should have 110 Hype to withdraw, but StakingManager1 won't be able to withdraw 110 from the validator as it has only 105 on the balance of validator1. In case the stakers of StakingManager1 want to withdraw all funds, there would be a shortage of 5 Hype.
- The protocol team stated that this liquidity should be withdrawn from StakingManager2 and staked to StakingManager1 by any user or protocol admin. While this is indeed possible, if StakingManager2 is created for an institution, it won't be possible to simply interact with it, as it has a whitelist enabled that limits actors who can participate.

### Recommendation
Consider ensuring and documenting that institutional usage of the protocol takes place via a separate instance of it, so all the StakingManagers' `MANAGER_ROLE` and ValidatorManager's `MANAGER_ROLE` belong to the same party, the institution, who was instructed to maintain enough stakes in each StakingManager, monitor the liquidity, and perform the necessary rebalancing between StakingManagers.
