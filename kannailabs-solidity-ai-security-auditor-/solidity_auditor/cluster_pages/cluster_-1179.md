# Cluster -1179

**Rank:** #282  
**Count:** 28  

## Label
Missing validation of initialization arguments and independent updates lets malformed state persist, causing account lockouts, failed validations, and unchecked registry changes that leave deployments nonfunctional or weaponize transitions.

## Examples

### Example 1

**Auto Label:** Inadequate input validation and improper state synchronization lead to invalid state transitions, incorrect data returns, and unauthorized operations, enabling malicious actors to forge messages, manipulate validator sets, or trigger harmful side effects.  

**Original Text Preview:**

In the [`initialize` function](https://github.com/matter-labs/zksync-sso-clave-contracts/blob/c7714c0fe0a33a23acce5aa20355f088d330b4f7/src/SsoAccount.sol#L59) of the `SsoAccount` contract, no validation is performed to ensure that the array arguments are non-empty. This omission allows the contract to be initialized in a state where it cannot perform any operations, rendering the account unusable.

Consider adding a validation check to ensure that at least one of the `initialValidators` or `initialK1Owners` arrays has a non-zero length before initialization. This will prevent the creation of non-functional accounts.

***Update:** Resolved in [pull request #371](https://github.com/matter-labs/zksync-sso-clave-contracts/pull/371) at commit [8454fce](https://github.com/matter-labs/zksync-sso-clave-contracts/pull/371/commits/8454fce35e9178ef394466d5b99096cde7a89d36).*

## Description

The `update_folio` instruction allows `program_version` and `program_deployment_slot` arguments to be passed independently (figure 9.1). However, if the owner passes one without the other, they risk locking themselves out of the program. The relevant code appears in figure 9.1. The first thing `update_folio` does is call `validate` on line 96, which calls `validate_folio_program_post_init` on line 70 of figure 9.2. The call to `validate_folio_program_post_init` results in a call to `validate_program_registrar`, part of which appears in figure 9.3.

```rust
85    pub fn handler(
86        ctx: Context<UpdateFolio>,
87        program_version: Option<Pubkey>,
88        program_deployment_slot: Option<u64>,
89        folio_fee: Option<u128>,
90        minting_fee: Option<u128>,
91        trade_delay: Option<u64>,
92        auction_length: Option<u64>,
93        fee_recipients_to_add: Vec<FeeRecipient>,
94        fee_recipients_to_remove: Vec<Pubkey>,
95    ) -> Result<()> {
96        ctx.accounts.validate()?;
```
*Figure 9.1: The `update_folio` function signature*  
*(dtfs-solana/programs/folio/src/instructions/owner/update_folio.rs#85–95)*

```rust
68    pub fn validate(&self) -> Result<()> {
69        let folio = self.folio.load()?;
70        folio.validate_folio_program_post_init(
71            &self.folio.key(),
72            Some(&self.program_registrar),
73            Some(&self.dtf_program),
74            Some(&self.dtf_program_data),
75            Some(&self.actor),
76            Some(Role::Owner),
77            None, // Can update no matter the status
78        )?;
79
80        Ok(())
81    }
```
*Figure 9.2: Definition of `UpdateFolio::validate`*  
*(dtfs-solana/programs/folio/src/instructions/owner/update_folio.rs#68–81)*

```rust
87    let deployment_slot = DtfProgram::get_program_deployment_slot(
88        &dtf_program.key(),
89        &dtf_program.to_account_info(),
90        &dtf_program_data.to_account_info(),
91    )?;
92
93    check_condition!(
94        self.program_deployment_slot == deployment_slot,
95        InvalidProgram
96    );
```
*Figure 9.3: Excerpt of `Folio::validate_program_registrar`*  
*(dtfs-solana/programs/folio/src/utils/accounts/folio.rs#87–96)*

The code in figure 9.3 determines the deployment slot using values stored in the Folio. The determined deployment slot is compared to the one stored in the Folio. If there is a mismatch, the call fails.

If the owner calls `update_folio` with only one of the two values and then calls `update_folio` again to correct the error, the second call will fail in `UpdateFolio::validate`.

## Exploit Scenario

Alice calls `update_folio` to update her deployment’s program ID and deployment slot; however, she forgets to pass the deployment slot. Alice notices her error and calls `update_folio` a second time to correct it. The second call to `update_folio` fails when it calls `UpdateFolio::validate`.

## Recommendations

Short term, have `update_folio` call `UpdateFolio::validate` before returning to ensure that subsequent calls to `UpdateFolio::validate` will succeed. This will reduce the likelihood that Folio owners will lock themselves out of the program.

Long term, expand the folio program’s tests. It is possible that this bug could have been found with more extensive negative (i.e., failing) tests.

## Diﬃculty: High

## Type: Data Validation

### Description
The `remove_from_registrar` function removes program IDs from the program registrar’s `accepted_programs` array. If presented with an ID not in the array, the function succeeds. In such a case, the function should return an error to indicate to the caller that something has gone wrong.

The relevant code appears in figure 8.1. The function loops through each element of `accepted_programs`. If a program cannot be found in the argument `program_ids`, the function simply proceeds to the next entry. Thus, if the caller passes a program ID that is not in `accepted_programs`, the caller will not be alerted to the error.

```rust
pub fn remove_from_registrar(&mut self, program_ids: Vec<Pubkey>) -> Result<()> {
    let mut new_programs = self.accepted_programs.to_vec();

    new_programs.iter_mut().for_each(|program| {
        if program_ids.contains(program) {
            *program = Pubkey::default();
        }
    });

    self.accepted_programs = new_programs.try_into().unwrap();

    Ok(())
}
```

**Figure 8.1:** Excerpt of `program_registrar.rs`  
*(dtfs-solana/programs/folio/src/utils/accounts/program_registrar.rs#30–42)*

### Exploit Scenario
Alice operates dtfs and folio deployments. Alice deploys a new copy of the dtfs program and calls `remove_from_registrar` to remove the old one. However, a typo causes the old deployment’s program ID to remain. Alice is unaware of the typo, as the call to `remove_from_registrar` succeeds.

### Recommendations
**Short term:** Have `remove_from_registrar` return an error when it is passed a program ID that is not in `accepted_programs`. This will reduce the likelihood that such situations will go unnoticed.

**Long term:** Expand the program registrar’s tests. It is possible that this bug could have been found with more extensive negative (i.e., failing) tests.
