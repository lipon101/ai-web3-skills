# Cluster -1049

**Rank:** #331  
**Count:** 20  

## Label
Failing to refresh TTLs or delete mappings after state changes leaves contract data either archived unexpectedly or leftover stale values, forcing manual restoration and causing inconsistent balances or state when the contract is next used.

## Cluster Information
- **Total Findings:** 20

## Examples

### Example 1

**Auto Label:** Inconsistent or incomplete storage deletion leads to stale state persistence, causing incorrect data exposure, false usage limits, and unauthorized access due to improper state synchronization.

Low Risk

## Description

When loans are closed by calling `closeIndividualLoan()`, the system fails to fully clear all associated data. While it removes the token, related records, it neglects to delete the core loan details stored in the `userLoans[user][loanId]` mapping. This permanently occupies storage space.

The `_removeTokenFromUser()` function fails to fully clear all loan-related storage, specifically neglecting to delete the loan data from `userLoans[user][loanId]`.

## Location of Affected Code

File: [src/CredifiERC20Adaptor.sol#L298](https://github.com/credifi/contracts-audit/blob/ba976bad4afaf2dc068ca9dcd78b38052d3686e3/src/CredifiERC20Adaptor.sol#L298)

```solidity
function _removeTokenFromUser(address user, uint256 tokenId) internal {
   _removeFromArray(userDepositedTokens[user], userTokenIndex[user], tokenId);

   delete tokenDepositor[tokenId];
   delete mintedCreditForToken[tokenId];
   delete tokenToLoanId[tokenId];
}
```

## Recommendation

Consider deleting all of the loan-related storage variables, specifically the `userLoans` mapping:

```diff
function _removeTokenFromUser(address user, uint256 tokenId) internal {
   _removeFromArray(userDepositedTokens[user], userTokenIndex[user], tokenId);

   delete tokenDepositor[tokenId];
   delete mintedCreditForToken[tokenId];
   delete tokenToLoanId[tokenId];
+  delete userLoans[user][loanId];
}
```

## Team Response

Fixed.

### Example 2

**Auto Label:** Inconsistent state cleanup and persistence mechanisms lead to stale, inaccurate, or lost data, enabling state inconsistencies, front-running, and unintended behavior due to improper storage management across operations.  

**Original Text Preview:**

Whenever operations modifying the data stored in the `instance` storage of the token contract such as minting or burning tokens are performed, the entire `instance` TTL [is increased](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/stellar-contracts/blob/01dbcb53d3992570dba5faf517a3d0502ebf1254/contracts/token/fungible/src/storage.rs#L47). However, other operations performed on the token contract, such as [querying balance](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/stellar-contracts/blob/01dbcb53d3992570dba5faf517a3d0502ebf1254/contracts/token/fungible/src/storage.rs#L58-L66) or [transferring tokens](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/stellar-contracts/blob/01dbcb53d3992570dba5faf517a3d0502ebf1254/contracts/token/fungible/src/storage.rs#L361-L382) between accounts, do not increase the `instance` TTL. As a result, it is possible that the token contract is used, but its data eventually becomes archived. As a result, it will have to be manually restored, which incurs an additional cost.

Consider increasing the contract's `instance` storage TTL on all operations querying or modifying the state of the contract. Alternatively, consider documenting the current design choice so that it is clear for the implementers.
