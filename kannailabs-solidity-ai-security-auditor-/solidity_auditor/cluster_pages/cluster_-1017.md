# Cluster -1017

**Rank:** #405  
**Count:** 11  

## Label
Missing checks on player participation state, balances, and payout amounts allow adversaries to bypass validation, causing unauthorized withdrawals, invalid game transitions, and financial loss once malformed game data is processed.

## Examples

### Example 1

**Auto Label:** Missing state validation and input checks enable unauthorized state transitions or invalid operations, leading to critical failures in contract logic and potential misuse of funds.

##### Description

The `burnAndBridge()` and `burnAndBridgeMulti()` functions in AssetController.sol lack input validation for the amount parameter. This allows transactions to be executed with zero amounts:

```
function burnAndBridge(
    address recipient,
    uint256 amount,
    bool unwrap,
    uint256 destChainId,
    address bridgeAdapter
) public payable nonReentrant whenNotPaused {
    uint256 _currentLimit = burningCurrentLimitOf(bridgeAdapter);
    if (_currentLimit < amount) revert IXERC20_NotHighEnoughLimits();
    _useBurnerLimits(bridgeAdapter, amount);
    IXERC20(token).burn(_msgSender(), amount);// @audit - amount is not checked for > 0// ...
}

function burnAndBridgeMulti(
    address recipient,
    uint256 amount,
    bool unwrap,
    uint256 destChainId,
    address[] memory adapters,
    uint256[] memory fees
) public payable nonReentrant whenNotPaused {
// ...
    IXERC20(token).burn(_msgSender(), amount);// @audit - amount is not checked for > 0// ...
}
```

  

The absence of zero-amount validation allows unnecessary transactions that consume gas without transferring value

##### Recommendation

It is recommended to add a zero-amount check at the start of both functions:

```
function burnAndBridge(...) public payable nonReentrant whenNotPaused {
    if (amount == 0) revert InvalidAmount();
// rest of the function
}

function burnAndBridgeMulti(...) public payable nonReentrant whenNotPaused {
    if (amount == 0) revert InvalidAmount();
// rest of the function
}
```

##### Remediation

**SOLVED:** Zero-amount check has been added.

### Example 2

**Auto Label:** Missing input and state validation leads to unauthorized fund withdrawals, invalid state transitions, and potential financial loss through improper checks on participation, game status, and balance constraints.  

**Original Text Preview:**

`emergencyEnd` function can be used with a player who has no game.

The function must check that the player is currently in a game.

```diff
     /// @dev In emergency scenarios where players are locked, this function can be used to unlock player and pay
     function emergencyEnd(address player, uint256 payout) external onlyAdmin whenNotPaused {
+        if (_strEq(playerGameId[player], "")) revert PlayerNotInGame(player);
         playerGameId[player] = "";

         balance[player] += payout;
```

### Example 3

**Auto Label:** Missing input and state validation leads to unauthorized fund withdrawals, invalid state transitions, and potential financial loss through improper checks on participation, game status, and balance constraints.  

**Original Text Preview:**

The `endGame` function can revert when players lose money and their balance doesn't cover the loss.

This is likely to happen when a player is slashed (reducing balance).
Then, `endGame` will revert due to insufficient balance.

```solidity
    function endGame(string calldata gameId, PlayerPayout[] memory playerPayouts) external onlyAdmin whenNotPaused {
        ...

        for (uint256 i = 0; i < playerPayouts.length; i++) {
            ...

            if (playerPayout.payout > playerPayout.stake) {
                // Player won money case
                ...
            } else {
                // Player lost money case

                uint256 deduction = playerPayout.stake - playerPayout.payout;

                if (balance[player] < deduction) revert InsufficientBalance(); // @POC: balance can be lower than deduction, reverting the transaction

                // deduct money from players' balance
                balance[player] -= deduction;
            }

            ...
        }

        ...
    }
```

When a player is slashed, the player should be out of the game.
