**Rank:** #51  
**Count:** 351  

## Label
Failing to reset approval or ownership state when reusing commitment or token IDs allows stale approvals to persist, enabling attackers to bypass controls and either block votes or drain tokens.

## Examples

### Example 1

**Auto Label:** Failure to invalidate or reset approvals during state changes, allowing malicious re-approval or execution of outdated transactions.  

**Original Text Preview:**

The `DistributedRewardDistribution` allows distributors to commit a reward distribution and then have other distributors approve it. When the number of approvals hit a threshold, the commit is considered approved and the rewards are distributed out.

During the commit process, the current commit is stored in a mapping as shown below:

```solidity
commitments[fromBlock][toBlock] = commitment;
approves[fromBlock][toBlock] = 1;
```

The current distributor can always call this function, and if they use the same `fromBlock` and `toBlock`, they can always overwrite the previous commitment. This also resets the approves count to 1.

The issue is that in the `approve` function, a certain commit can only be approved once, no matter if its an overwritten or a new commit.

```solidity
require(!alreadyApproved[commitment][msg.sender], "Already approved");
    approves[fromBlock][toBlock]++;
    alreadyApproved[commitment][msg.sender] = true;
```

Now consider the following scenario:

1. There are 10 distributors. The limit for approvals is 5.
2. Distributor 1 adds a commitment for blocks 1-100. 3 other distributors approve it.
3. After 256 blocks, distributor 2 gains control. They call `commit` again and overwrite the previous commitment with a different one, but for the same 1-100 blocks.
4. After another 256 blocks, distributor 3 gains control and resubmits the original commitment made by distributor 1 for 1-100 blocks. Now, the distributors who voted before cannot vote anymore, since `alreadyApproved[commitment][msg.sender]` is set to true. So even though the contract labels it as approved by the distributor, the `approves` mapping does not reflect that.

This can deny votes in case of resubmissions, and also breaks the invariant that the `approves` should contain the same number as the number of unique addresses whose `alreadyApproved` mapping is true.

Since we are resetting the `approves` count to 1, we should use a fresh `alreadyApproved` mapping. Consider adding a `commitmentId` variable which increases on every commit. The approvals mapping should then implement an extra key and use `alreadyApproved[commitment][commitmentId][msg.sender]` instead, which will reset the already given approvals for the resubmitted commitment.

### Example 2

**Auto Label:** Flawed ownership and approval validation leads to unauthorized access, denial of service, and incorrect token state, enabling users to bypass intended access controls or manipulate token balances.  

**Original Text Preview:**

The `ownerOf` function in the `VotingEscrow` contract does not revert when queried with a non-existent token ID. This can lead to misleading behavior in the contract.

```solidity
function ownerOf(uint _tokenId) public view returns (address) {
    return idToOwner[_tokenId];
}
```

This is inconsistent with EIP-721:

```solidity
    /// @notice Find the owner of an NFT
    /// @dev NFTs assigned to zero address are considered invalid, and queries
    ///  about them do throw.
    /// @param _tokenId The identifier for an NFT
    /// @return The address of the owner of the NFT
    function ownerOf(uint256 _tokenId) external view returns (address);
```

## Description

Inside `VotingEscrow.withdraw`, there is `_isApprovedOrOwner` check, which allows an approved `tokenId` spender to trigger this operation.

```solidity
    function withdraw(uint _tokenId) external nonreentrant {
>>>     assert(_isApprovedOrOwner(msg.sender, _tokenId));
        require(attachments[_tokenId] == 0 && !voted[_tokenId], "attached");

        LockedBalance memory _locked = locked[_tokenId];
        require(block.timestamp >= _locked.end, "The lock didn't expire");
        uint value = uint(int256(_locked.amount));

        locked[_tokenId] = LockedBalance(0, 0);
        uint supply_before = supply;
        supply = supply_before - value;

        // old_locked can have either expired <= timestamp or zero end
        // _locked has only 0 end
        // Both can have >= 0 amount
        _checkpoint(_tokenId, _locked, LockedBalance(0, 0));

        assert(IERC20(token).transfer(msg.sender, value));

        // Burn the NFT
        _burn(_tokenId);

        emit Withdraw(msg.sender, _tokenId, value, block.timestamp);
        emit Supply(supply_before, supply_before - value);
    }
```

```solidity
    function _isApprovedOrOwner(
        address _spender,
        uint _tokenId
    ) internal view returns (bool) {
        address owner = idToOwner[_tokenId];
        bool spenderIsOwner = owner == _spender;
>>>     bool spenderIsApproved = _spender == idToApprovals[_tokenId];
        bool spenderIsApprovedForAll = (ownerToOperators[owner])[_spender];
        return spenderIsOwner || spenderIsApproved || spenderIsApprovedForAll;
    }
```

However, inside `_burn`, when `approve` is called to reset `tokenId` approval, there is a check that prevent the approved spender to perform the operation.

```solidity
    function approve(address _approved, uint _tokenId) public {
        address owner = idToOwner[_tokenId];
        // Throws if `_tokenId` is not a valid NFT
        require(owner != address(0));
        // Throws if `_approved` is the current owner
        require(_approved != owner);
        // Check requirements
        bool senderIsOwner = (idToOwner[_tokenId] == msg.sender);
        bool senderIsApprovedForAll = (ownerToOperators[owner])[msg.sender];
>>>     require(senderIsOwner || senderIsApprovedForAll);
        // Set the approval
        idToApprovals[_tokenId] = _approved;
        emit Approval(owner, _approved, _tokenId);
    }
```

## Recommendations

Consider resetting `idToApprovals` directly inside the `_burn` function instead of calling `approve`.
