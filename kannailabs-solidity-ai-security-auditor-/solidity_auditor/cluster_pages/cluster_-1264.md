**Rank:** #201  
**Count:** 55  

## Label
Neglected cleanup of stale mappings after key rotations and racing updates lets outdated users or shares remain, so subsequent deposits or epoch unwinds misdirect funds or revert operations.

## Examples

### Example 1

**Auto Label:** Race conditions and improper state updates lead to denial of service, fund loss, or broken rollover flows due to flawed indexing, premature checks, or stale references in critical system operations.  

**Original Text Preview:**

`ZipperFactoryKey` is used to assign `keyToUser`, where we can also update the old `keyToUser`, by assigning a new user:

```solidity
  function changeKey(uint16 chainId, address user, bytes memory key) external onlyRole(CHANGE_KEY_ROLE) {
    require(chain.validateEncodedAddress(chainId, key), "Invalid key");

    bytes memory oldKey = userToKey[chainId][user];
    require(oldKey.length > 0, "Key does not exist for user");
    require(keccak256(oldKey) != keccak256(key), "Key is the same");

    userToKey[chainId][user] = key;
    keyToUser[chainId][key] = user;
```

This issue we have here is that `user` at `keyToUser[chainId][oldKey]` is never removed, meaning even after changing the `userToKey` to a new key and `keyToUser` to a new user, the map `keyToUser[chainId][oldKey]` still contain the old `user`.


This map is used when requesting a deposit:

```solidity
  function reqDepositZToken( ... ) external nonReentrant onlyRole(RELAYER_ROLE) {
    // ...

    address user = keyFactory.keyToUser(chainId, receiver);

    // ...

    Request memory request = Request({
      reqType: REQ_DEPOSIT_ZTOKEN,
      chainId: chainId,
      // NOTE srcHashTx are enought to be unique identifiers
      payload: abi.encode(zToken, sender, receiver, user, zAmount, srcHashTx, srcHashIdx)
    });
```

Where it's extremely dangerous as this user is the one receiving the funds when we `executeRequest`:

```solidity
  function executeRequest(uint256 _requestId) external nonReentrant onlyRole(EXECUTOR_ROLE) {
    // ...
    if (request.reqType == REQ_DEPOSIT_ZTOKEN) {
      (address zToken, , , address user, uint256 zAmount, , ) = abi.decode(
        request.payload,
        (address, bytes, bytes, address, uint256, bytes, uint256)
      );
      tokenFactory.mintZToken(request.chainId, zToken, user, zAmount);
```

In short if the old key is entered, then the tokens will be transferred to the old user, which can be a no longer used address or abandoned contract.

Note that it's the same in `ZipperFactoryVault::changeVault`, but the impact there is non-existent.

Recommendations:

Remove the old key from `keyToUser`:
```diff
    userToKey[chainId][user] = key;
    keyToUser[chainId][key] = user;
+   delete keyToUser[chainId][oldKey];
```

## Security Audit Report

## Function
### Severity
High Risk

### Context
`LockingController.sol#L253`

### Description
LockedPositionTokens are transferable unrestricted until used to vote. This allows holders to perform blind transfers to the gateway contract. The above capability coupled with the `LockingController.increaseUnwindingEpochs` use of `msg.sender`'s balance means that the existence of any prior transfers to the gateway result in attempting to burnFrom the gateway an amount larger than it will ever approve.

### Proof of Concept

#### Scenario:
- Alice creates a position.
- Bob creates a position.
- Bob sends his position to the gateway.
- Alice attempts to `increaseUnwindingEpochs` and reverts.

The revert is due to the function attempting to `burnFrom` the gateway both her position and Bob's transferred tokens. 

Below is a modified version of `testIncreaseUnwindingEpochs` which now reverts with the addition of Bob's transfer.

```solidity
function testDosIncreaseUnwindingEpochs() public {
    _createPosition(alice, 1000, 10);
    _createPosition(bob, 1000, 10);
    LockedPositionToken liusd = LockedPositionToken(lockingController.shareToken(10));
    
    // Mirrors `testIncreaseUnwindingEpochs` test with the only difference being Bob transfers to the gateway.
    vm.prank(bob);
    liusd.transfer(address(gateway), 1000);
    
    assertEq(
        lockingController.balanceOf(alice),
        1000,
        "Error: Alice's balance after creating first position is not correct"
    );
    assertEq(
        lockingController.rewardWeight(alice),
        1200,
        "Error: Alice's reward weight after creating first position is not correct"
    );
    assertEq(
        lockingController.shares(alice, 10),
        1000,
        "Error: Alice's share after creating first position is not correct"
    );
    assertEq(
        lockingController.shares(alice, 12),
        0,
        "Error: Alice's share after increasing unwinding epochs is not correct"
    );

    vm.startPrank(alice);
    {
        MockERC20(lockingController.shareToken(10)).approve(address(gateway), 1000);
        gateway.increaseUnwindingEpochs(10, 12);
    }
    vm.stopPrank();

    assertEq(
        lockingController.balanceOf(alice),
        1000,
        "Error: Alice's balance after increasing unwinding epochs is not correct"
    ); // unchanged
    assertEq(
        lockingController.rewardWeight(alice),
        1240,
        "Error: Alice's reward weight after increasing unwinding epochs is not correct"
    ); // +40
    assertEq(
        lockingController.shares(alice, 10),
        0,
        "Error: Alice's share after increasing unwinding epochs is not correct"
    ); // -1000
    assertEq(
        lockingController.shares(alice, 12),
        1000,
        "Error: Alice's share after increasing unwinding epochs is not correct"
    ); // +1000
}
```

### Recommendation
In the gateway, make use of the shares variable `uint256 shares = liusd.balanceOf(msg.sender);` and pass as an argument into `LockingController.increaseUnwindingEpochs`. This requires an interface edit to `LockingController` as well.

### Example 3

**Auto Label:** Race conditions and improper state updates lead to denial of service, fund loss, or broken rollover flows due to flawed indexing, premature checks, or stale references in critical system operations.  

**Original Text Preview:**

The module allows a registered chainlink upkeep to automatically re-lock aura locks

Funds cannot be stolen in any way

Due to the lax timing and lack of MEV, I cannot expect the upkeep to cause any particular issue

It's worth noting that in case you want to deprecate the module, for example to stop re-locking, it will be sufficient to remove it from the safe modules

There is no particular risk tied to adding this module as in the worst case it will consume a bit of `LINK` token to perform the upkeep
