### Example 1

**Auto Label:** Precision loss and logic flaws in reward calculations due to improper handling of fixed-point arithmetic, incorrect loop bounds, and inconsistent state updates, leading to systematic underpayment, denial of service, and wealth leakage.  

**Original Text Preview:**

In the `Flip` contract, during the `netPayout` calculation in the `flip()` function, it was noticed during testing that the user's `netPayout` is sometimes less than the `betAmount` they paid to participate in the game. For certain coin/heads combinations, the user ends up with a payout lower than the amount they bet, resulting in a loss for the player rather than a win, which makes it non-rewarding for players even if they win.

A `CoinFlipTest` test file is setup with a 10% `feePercentage` (`feePercentage` = 1000) and with a `betAmount` of 100 (where the bet token is assumed to have 18 decimals), to observe at which `numberOfCoins` to `headsRequired` combinations the calculated `netPayout` (reward) starts to be less than the game `betAmount`:

```solidity

        uint256 numberOfCoins = 10;

Recommendations:

Consider updating the `flip()` function to revert the transaction if the calculated `netPayout` is less than the `betAmount`.

### Summary


https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-03-symm-io-stacking/blob/main/token/contracts/staking/SymmStaking.sol#L402-L423

_updateRewardsStates can be triggered as often as each block (2 seconds) via deposit/withdraw/claim/notifyRewardAmount

e.g. if there's 1209.6e6 USDC rewards for one week (604800 seconds)


https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-03-symm-io-stacking/blob/main/token/contracts/staking/SymmStaking.sol#L374

rate = 1209_600000 / 604800 = 2000 "usdc units" per second


https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-03-symm-io-stacking/blob/main/token/contracts/staking/SymmStaking.sol#L194-L202

if SYMM total staked supply is 1_000_000e18 (~26560 usd), and we call `deposit` each block, then [`perTokenStored` will be increased by](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-03-symm-io-stacking/blob/main/token/contracts/staking/SymmStaking.sol#L412):

2 * 2000 * 1e18 / 1_000_000e18 = 4_000 / 1_000_000 = 0

Therefore, `perTokenStored` will not increase, but [`lastUpdated` will be increased](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-03-symm-io-stacking/blob/main/token/contracts/staking/SymmStaking.sol#L413), therefore users will not receive any USDC rewards for staking.

In this particular example, triggering `_updateRewardsStates` once in 249 blocks would be sufficient, as it would still result in rewards rounding down to zero.


### Root Cause

Lack of upscaling for tokens with less than 18 decimals for reward calculations.

### Attack Path

1. Attacker calls deposit/withdraw/notifyRewardAmount with any non-zero amount every block (or less often as long as the calculation will still round down to zero)

### Impact

High: stakers do not receive rewards in tokens with low decimals (e.g. USDC, USDT).

### PoC

1. SYMM total staked supply = 1_000_000e18
2. `notifyRewardAmount` is called with 1209.6 USDC
3. griefer calls `deposit/withdraw` 1 wei of SYMM each 249 blocks for 1 week
4. USDC rewards are stuck in the contract, instead of being distributed to stakers (but can be rescued by admin)

### Mitigation

Introduce 1e12 multiplier for reward calculation, and divide the accumulated rewards by 1e12 when they are being claimed.

## Description
1. In `ReserveLogic` and `MiniPoolReserveLogic`, we have:
   ```solidity
   // Calculate the last principal variable debt.
   vars.previousVariableDebt = scaledVariableDebt.rayMul(previousVariableBorrowIndex);
   ```
   Here, principal means the actual debt principal plus the accrued interest.
   
2. In liquidation flows, the word principal is used in conjunction with reserve to mean the debt or borrow reserve.

3. In `RewardsDistributor` and `RewardsDistributor6909`, we have:
   ```solidity
   /**
    * @dev Calculates rewards based on principal balance and index difference.
    * @param principalUserBalance User's principal balance.
    * @param reserveIndex Current reserve index.
    * @param userIndex User's stored index.
    * @param decimals Number of decimals.
    * @return The calculated reward amount.
    */
   function _getRewards(
       uint256 principalUserBalance,
       uint256 reserveIndex,
       uint256 userIndex,
       uint8 decimals
   ) internal pure returns (uint256) {
       return (principalUserBalance * (reserveIndex - userIndex)) / 10 ** decimals;
   }
   ```
   Here, principal is supposed to represent the amount of shares, which is actually not the initial principal deposited or borrowed by the user.

4. In `AToken`, the word principal actually matches what we would consider as principal:
   ```solidity
   // The balance of the user: principal balance + interest generated by the principal.
   super.balanceOf(user).rayMul(
       _pool.getReserveNormalizedIncome(_underlyingAsset, RESERVE_TYPE)
   )
   ```

5. In `VariableDebtToken.sol#L277-L284` and `VariableDebtToken.sol#L304-L317`, the word principal refers to the shares and total shares in this token.

## Recommendation
In most cases, the comments or variable names need to be updated to reflect the actual value computed or stored. However, in case 3, the confusion can result in computing incorrect reward amounts for the user. The question comes into mind: should the user be awarded based on:
- The principal deposited or borrowed (the true meaning of the word) or...
- The shares of the `aToken` or `debtToken` the user holds.

If it's the first point, then the reward distribution flow needs to be updated, and the tokens would also need to store principal values along with the shares to be able to provide them to the incentive controllers.
