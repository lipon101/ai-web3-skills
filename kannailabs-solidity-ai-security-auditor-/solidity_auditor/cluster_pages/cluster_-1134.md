# Cluster -1134

**Rank:** #109  
**Count:** 154  

## Label
Failure to validate untrusted strings and SQL inputs before processing and enforcing permissions lets attackers inject payloads, corrupt database state, and trigger unauthorized data changes that can cascade into denial of service.

## Examples

### Example 1

**Auto Label:** **Improper input validation leading to injection and unauthorized data manipulation.**  

**Original Text Preview:**

**Description:** An attack vector which spans the intersection between web3 and web2 is when users can [associate arbitrary metadata strings with NFTs](https://medium.com/zokyo-io/under-the-hackers-hood-json-injection-in-nft-metadata-3be78d0f93a7) and those strings are later processed or displayed on a website.

In particular the `IStory::Story` event:
* is emitted by a non-trusted entity, the current holder of the artwork
* emits two arbitrary string parameters, `collectorName` and `story`
* these string parameters are designed to be displayed to users and may be processed by web2 apps

**Recommended Mitigation:** The most important validation is for non-trusted user-initiated functions, eg:
* When a Creator emits `CreatorStory` or a Collector emits `Story`, revert if the `name` and `story` strings contain any unexpected special characters
* When minting tokens revert if `TokenURISet::uriWhenRedeemable` and `uriWhenNotRedeemable` contain any unexpected special characters - though this must be done using off-chain components controlled by the protocol so risk here is minimal
* In off-chain code don't trust any user-supplied strings but sanitize them or check them for unexpected special characters

**CryptoArt:**
Acknowledged; mitigation handled off-chain via URI validation pre-signing, Story string sanitization/encoding post-event.

## Security Awareness Training Recommendation for Thala

## Severity: Low Risk

### Description
Thala would benefit from implementing structured security awareness training. While technical security measures are in place, the human element requires strengthening through targeted education, particularly given the increasing sophistication of attacks targeting DeFi protocols.

### Recommendation
- Consider implementing KnowBe4's security training platform ([knowbe4.com](https://knowbe4.com)) to establish baseline security awareness and conduct regular phishing simulations. Their small-team pricing options and crypto-specific scenarios make this a practical choice for Thala's size and needs.
- The Red Guild's Phishing Dojo ([phishing.rektgames.xyz](https://phishing.rektgames.xyz)) offers free, interactive training specifically designed for crypto teams. This can complement KnowBe4 by providing hands-on practice with signature verification, transaction analysis, and scam site identification.
- Additionally, schedule monthly team security sessions to discuss "The Art of Social Engineering" concepts and rotate security topic presentations among team members.

### Implementation Plan
Given the small team size:
- Assign a security champion role.
- Use a simple spreadsheet for tracking.
- Integrate training into existing team meetings.
- Focus on high-impact, low-friction activities.

## Security Report

## Severity: Low Risk

### Description
The `GET()` handler in `echelon/app/api/cron/points/route.txs` contains two SQL injection vulnerabilities. While the likelihood of exploitation is low since both injection points rely on trusted 3rd party data sources, following security best practices would suggest using parameterized queries in both cases.

1. **Error Message SQL Injection**: In the catch block of the `GET()` handler, error messages are directly interpolated into an SQL query string:

   ```javascript
   catch (e) {
       console.error(e);
       const message: string = e instanceof Error ? e.message : String(e);
       await client.query(`
           INSERT INTO points_snapshot_status (success, error_message)
           VALUES (FALSE, '${message}');`);
   }
   ```

2. **Points Data SQL Injection**: When inserting points data from the `fetchAllPoints()` response:

   ```javascript
   const values = data
       .map(
           (item) => `(
               '${item.account}',
               ${item.borrowPoints},
               ${item.lendPoints},
           )`
       )
       .join(",");
   ```

Both cases involve direct string concatenation into SQL queries without parameterization. The `VALUES` clause structure makes it possible to break out of both the string context and parentheses using a payload like `') <malicious SQL> --`.

An attacker who could control either error messages or points data could potentially execute arbitrary SQL commands. However, since both data sources are trusted internal systems, the actual risk of malicious exploitation is low.

The likelihood of exploitation is low since both vulnerabilities require control of trusted data sources - either internal error messages or the points API response. However, the technical complexity of exploitation is also low due to the direct string concatenation and simple injection pattern.

### Recommendation

1. **For error handling**:

   ```javascript
   catch (e) {
       console.error(e);
       const message: string = e instanceof Error ? e.message : String(e);
       await client.query(
           'INSERT INTO points_snapshot_status (success, error_message) VALUES ($1, $2)',
           [false, message]
       );
   }
   ```

2. **For points data**:

   ```javascript
   const valueParams = data.map((_, i) => `($${i * 3 + 1}, $${i * 3 + 2}, $${i * 3 + 3}, 0)`).join(',');
   const flatValues = data.flatMap(item => [
       item.account,
       item.borrowPoints,
       item.lendPoints
   ]);
   await client.query(`
       INSERT INTO points_snapshot (account, borrow_points, lend_points, referral_points)
       VALUES ${valueParams}
   `, flatValues);
   ```
